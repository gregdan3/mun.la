I'm not going to cover everything- I can't- but I'll cover enough to get you started, and shoutout some resources at the end to help you keep going!<p>We are going to briefly discuss all of the following:<ul><li>How words work<li>sitelen pona<li>pronouns<li>basic sentences<li>modifiers<li>questions<li>a bit of interjections<li>objects</ul><p>This leaves a <em>lot</em> on the cutting room floor, including commands and instructions, context, prepositions, preverbs, semantic spaces, names, numbers, the list of words and their meanings, and certainly more. Not to mention, I'm only going over each of these topics briefly.<p>But don't worry: As important as they are, you won't need prepositions to get started. In most language learning, we'd start with asking where the bathroom is. But conveniently, we can skip this, because most Toki Pona is spoken on the internet. The question would be totally useless!<p>Let's get started.<h1 id=how-words-work>How Words Work</h1><p>In Toki Pona, words are broad. Like, really broad. Imagine the English word fruit for example: it doesn't mean "apple" or "banana" or "durian", but it can refer to any of these.<p>Toki Pona words all work like this: they "mean" some broad concept, but can refer to lots of specific things that fit into that concept.<p>It goes a step further too- nouns don't mark their number, and verbs don't mark their tense. You'll see what I mean when we get to translations.<p>Let's look at the name of the language to demonstrate how this works in Toki Pona:<p>toki refers to speech, conversation, thought, and language. It's not any one of these- it's all of them, as one big idea-blob: communication, in all its forms.<p>pona refers to good things like friendliness, positivity, being helpful, and fixing things. Again, not any one of these, but all of them at once: positive things and traits of all kinds.<p>But together, "toki pona" can mean "friendly conversation", "positive thought", and of course "good language".<p>For time reasons, I'm not going to be defining each of the words as I go- I'll give valid and helpful translations, and I'll spend more time on really important words, but I'm going to be focusing mainly on the grammar, the really big concepts you need to get started. As I translate, keep the "broad words" idea in mind! Hopefully, all the sentences I go over will be small enough that you can tell apart the words I do define from the ones I only provide in translations.<p>But before we get to sentences, or grammar, or translations, we need to talk about these symbols!<h1 id=sitelen-pona>sitelen pona</h1><p>This here, that you've already seen, is the "logo" of sorts for Toki Pona. The circle with three lines over it is the word "toki", and the smile-like curve on the inside is the word "pona". In normal writings, you'll usually see words side by side rather than one inside the other, but it means the same either way.<p>This way of writing is called "sitelen pona", literally "good writing", and it is toki pona's most adorable writing system.<p>sitelen pona is logographic, so each word has a symbol. Every symbol means exactly one word, and nearly all the words have exactly one symbol- assuming they do have exactly one works for this talk. Lastly, each symbol is representative of the idea of the word! Even grammar words look a bit like punctuation to my English-reading eyes.<p>Anyway, For this talk, all sitelen pona will be annotated with their pronunciation, but I encourage you to study the sitelen pona alongside the language itself!<p>Alright, <em>now</em> we can actually start on the language.<h1 id=mi-and-sina-and-ona>mi and sina and ona</h1><p>mi, sina, and ona are toki pona's pronouns, and you'll be using them a lot! In fact, you'll use mi and sina so much, that they're a little different from other subjects.<p>Let's look at some sentences. These first few will have just a subject and a verb:<blockquote><p>mi pona, "I am well" or "We are good". mi is a first person pronoun: I, we, me.</blockquote><blockquote><p>sina suwi, "You are cute", or "Y'all are adorable". sina is a second person pronoun: you, y'all.</blockquote><blockquote><p>ona li sona, "They understand", or "They know". ona is a third person pronoun: they, it, he, she.</blockquote><p>In the first two sentences, mi and sina are the subject and are immediately followed by a verb- the action of the sentence. This is always the case: if mi and sina are the exact subject, the verb always comes next.<p>But in the third, ona is followed by the word "li". For ona, and all other subjects <em>besides</em> mi and sina, li goes afterward and marks the start of the verb.<p>mi and sina are special because doing it this way is a little more natural, and a little more comfortable to say.<p>Otherwise, these three are all the same kind of sentence: a subject, then a verb. Let's look at a few more:<blockquote><p>mi lape, "I rested", "I slept", "I will relax"</blockquote><blockquote><p>sina kute, "You listened", "y'all will listen"</blockquote><blockquote><p>ona li suli, "It was tall", "She will be important"</blockquote><p>This is a good moment to remind you of the whole "nouns don't mark number, verbs don't mark tense" thing.<p>In the previous set of translations, we noted that "mi pona" can mean "I am well", or "we are good". "mi" could have been just the speaker, or a group including the speaker.<p>In these translations, we noted that "sina kute" can mean "You listened", or "y'all will listen". "kute", listening, could have happened at any time- not just the present.<p>In fact, we can go another step further- Toki Pona's verb doesn't tell apart "doing" from "being." This means the verb can be an action, or a description, and grammatically these two are identical.<p>So you might be wondering, how are you supposed to tell apart all these different cases if the sentence doesn't tell you?<p>The answer is context. If you're speaking directly to a friend and nobody else, and they say "mi", they probably mean just themselves.<p>If you're in a big group walking down the street but need to split up, you might hear somebody else say "sina" and figure they mean the half of the group that they aren't in.<p>And if context isn't enough, you can always add more information by adding more words to the sentence.<hr><p>We'll cover that shortly, but let's have a bonus pronoun before we continue:<p>We also have "ni", a demonstrative pronoun, which means this, that, these, or those. Here are a few sentences:<blockquote><p>ni li nasa, "That was strange", "Those are unusual"</blockquote><blockquote><p>ni li wawa, "This is amazing", "That is forceful", "These are powerful"</blockquote><p>li makes a return, marking the verb for us. You'll see "li" a <em>lot</em>. Fun fact: It's easier to tell part "mi pona" and "ni li pona" because of the grammatical difference, the use of the word li in one and not the other! And believe me, that difference is important.<p>Otherwise, "ni" works about how you'd expect! It can refer to objects near and far from you, ideas you're about to speak or just spoke, and tons more.<p>So now, we have a handle on the pronouns. We can talk about ourselves with mi, people we're speaking to with sina, other people and things with ona, and anything we can point at with ni.<h1 id=modifiers>Modifiers</h1><p>Next, we're gonna look at modifiers. You might know them better as adjectives- same thing, but for every part of speech.<p>As a matter of fact, we already saw one of these: in the name of the language, "pona" is a modifier!<p>You'll note the translations I gave earlier were all types of communication, even if they were specifically "good" communication: positive thought, friendly conversation, good language.<p>This tells us something important about modifiers: Modifiers can't change what the thing is, only make it more specific. Wiiiith one exception in the word "ala", which we'll get to soon.<p>But otherwise, this means you could pretend the modifiers are not in the phrase, and still be able to understand the sentence. And this is a good way to practice!<p>But modifiers can provide very helpful information in understanding what something is, or telling apart multiple similar things. Here's some example sentences:<blockquote><p>ni li akesi lili, "this is a small frog", "that was a tiny snake". We have "akesi", a reptile, and it's now lili- small. It's still "akesi", like "toki pona" is still "toki!"</blockquote><blockquote><p>jan ni li kama, "this person has arrived", "those people are coming". We can use our pronouns to modify things, and modifying things with ni to point them out or refer back to them is super helpful!</blockquote><blockquote><p>nasin kiwen jelo li suli, "The yellow brick road is long". You can have any number of modifiers on a word, and the order of those modifiers doesn't usually matter.</blockquote><p>What we see in these sentences is that modifiers can apply to any part of speech- right now, we only have the subject and verb, but we'll have objects and prepositions shortly.<p>In fact, let's practice that any-part-of-speech idea by rewriting two of these sentences:<blockquote><p>akesi ni li lili, "this frog is small", "that snake was tiny." We're giving the same information as in "ni li akesi lili", but now "ni" is a modifier, and "lili" is the verb!</blockquote><blockquote><p>nasin ni li kiwen jelo li suli. "This road is made of yellow brick, and long." That's right: we can have more than one li! And the other bit, which you may have noticed, is that the verb of the sentence can convey descriptive information.</blockquote><p>Alright, that's enough on modifiers. Now, we need to get to questions- and once you have questions down, you'll have everything you need to have a conversation! Except, you know, all the words- buuuuut we don't have all day!<h1 id=your-first-question>Your first question</h1><p>So, In Toki Pona, questions are expressed with the grammar, and they have three forms. Let's look at each:<blockquote><p>ona li lukin ala lukin?, "Is he looking?", or "Are they staring?".</blockquote><p>This type of question takes the first word of the verb, here "lukin", doubles it, and puts "ala" between the two. You could translate this question more literally as "Is he looking or not looking?"<p>You'll recognize the word "ala" from the modifiers section before- it's that "one exception" I mentioned, where as a modifier it changes the word it modifies. We're almost to the explanation, but for now it's just helping us mark questions. Here's another sentence:<blockquote><p>ni li lipu ala lipu?, "Is this a piece of paper?" or "Is that a leaf?".</blockquote><p>This, and the question before, are yes or no questions, but Toki Pona has no word for "yes" or "no". Instead, you repeat the verb for yes, so to that first question we could say "lukin.", meaning "Looking". Or, you can say "ala" or "lukin ala", "not looking." And for the second question, we would say "lipu" for yes, or "ala." or "lipu ala" for no.<p>There's that explanation for ala! When answering a question, you add it to negative answers to say "no". In general, ala can be used as a modifier to mean "not". "lipu ala" would mean "not a card", or "not a book". You can use ala as a modifier in normal sentences too, but we'll focus on asking and answering questions for now.<hr><p>Here's the next type of question, and it's even easier to follow:<blockquote><p>sina musi anu seme?, "Are you having fun?" "Are you funny?"</blockquote><blockquote><p>mi ante anu seme?, "Am I different?" "Am I changed?"</blockquote><p>This is also a yes-no question, and you answer the same way: to the first question, you can say "musi" for yes, and "ala" or "musi ala" for no. Same deal for the second question, "ante" for yes, "ante ala" or "ala" for no.<p>But the grammar is a little more open-ended here. The phrase "anu seme" is tacked onto the end of a statement, in order to indicate that the statement is a question- that phrase can be put onto the end of a sentence no matter how long it is.<p>There are actually a few "technically" things I could say about this type of question- you can technically put the phrase "anu seme" onto any part of speech, not just the end of the sentence. And, technically, this question format can indicate uncertainty without expecting an answer- we won't worry about either of those, for now, but you'll run into them as you explore the community.<p>Oh, but there is one more "technically" that is important: You can answer this type of question with "ni" for yes, or "ni ala" or "ala" for no. Interpreting it literally in English as "this" or "not this" makes it a little silly sounding, but it is very clear in practice.<p>The meaning in answering the question is essentially the same, but some speakers prefer this way of answering questions, especially anu seme questions, because it's a little easier to know what to respond with, and it more clearly confirms or denies the entire sentence.<p>Let's do one more of these questions before we continue:<blockquote><p>ilo mi li kalama anu seme? "Is my phone making sound?" "Is my drill noisy?"</blockquote><p>The subject is "ilo mi", my tool, and the verb is "kalama," sound. "anu seme" indicates this is a question as we've discussed, so this is a question asking whether my tool is making sound or not.<hr><p>Alright, one more type of question, and this is the most important one.<p>So, that word "seme" from before does more than just live in the phrase "anu seme". It also works on its own, and can replace essentially any word that isn't part of the grammar.<p>seme stands in for any missing information, so you can use it to ask any sort of who, what, where, when, why, which, or how type of question.<p>With the grammar we have so far, subject-verb sentences and modifiers, we can only really ask "who" or "what". But let's do that!<blockquote><p>"sina seme?", "what are you doing?"</blockquote><p>Here, the subject is "sina" or "you", and "seme" is the verb- the entire verb. So this question is asking, what action are you taking? Or, what describes you? Let's try another:<blockquote><p>"seme li ni?", "What did this?" "Who did that?"</blockquote><p>Here, the subject is seme- so we're asking for the actor, the something or somebody who did something. And that something is just "ni"- this, or that. That is to say, we're trying to figure out who or what did some thing we're looking at, pointing at, or referencing. ni can just be a verb- an action or maybe description that we can point at, or have recently talked about, or will talk about.<p>But what about answering these questions? Turns out, you already know how- you just fill in the blank. This can mean saying just the word or phrase that fits, or repeating the sentence with the word "seme" replaced with your answer.<p>For example, the question "sina seme" can be answered with "pali", "working", or "mi pali", "I am working." The first fills in the blank, and the second restates the sentence, but both provide the same information.<p>Let's do another one of these before we move on.<blockquote><p>"ni li moku seme"? "What kind of food is this?"</blockquote><p>Here, seme is now a <em>modifier</em>- we're asking for a word to describe "moku", the food. And we could answer- "suwi!" sweet! or "nasa," "strange!" or with a complete sentence describing the origin and ingredients of the food!<p>What we learn here is that seme fits into the subject or verb, and can be a modifier of another word in any part of speech. seme can also fit into other parts of speech we haven't covered yet- it's amazingly versatile, so try it on lots of things!<p>We have two more topics, but the next one is brief. Let's go!<h1 id=interjections>Interjections</h1><p>You know all those questions we answered before? The answers are interjections- words or phrases, but not complete sentences. That much is obvious-<p>But there are more types of interjections. As a general statement, any non-grammar word can be an interjection, and what they mean as an interjection has to do with the meaning of the word.<p>For example, It's pretty clear how "ala" relates to "no."<p>But <em>every</em> word does this- "toki" is used for "hello," kinda like starting a conversation by saying "conversation!"<p>"pona", good and pleasant, is used to positively acknowledge something.<p>"sona", knowledge and knowing, is used to indicate you understand something.<p>"wawa", powerful and strong, is used to say something is impressive or amazing.<p>And the word "a" can be used for essentially any emotion or emphasis.<p>This list is not exhaustive- it's a pile of examples. But interjections come up a <em>lot</em> in conversation, so they're pretty important.<p>But uh, the real trick here is that I added this whole section just to tell you that "toki" is how we say "hello!"<h1 id=objects>Objects</h1><p>So lastly, we come to objects. This is another major part of speech, and gives us a whole new dimension of sentence types to mess with: subject, then verb, then object. The sentences in this section will be the longest in the presentation, so listen carefully!<p>My recommendation? Pay close attention to the grammatical particles- they can guide your way.<p>Let's look at an example sentence:<blockquote><p>mi pana e sona</blockquote><p>In this sentence, the subject is "mi", I. The verb is "pana", "give". And the object is "sona", knowledge. Together, this is "I give knowledge."<p>As with the grammatical object in other languages, the object is a distinct thing in the sentence that the subject is interacting with.<p>The prior sentence is how we'd express teaching- to give knowledge.<p>Let's look at another, longer sentence.<blockquote><p>soweli li moku e kili kiwen e kasi. "The animal ate hard fruit and plants", "the mouse is eating seeds and grass." Yes, you can have more than one "e" too!</blockquote><p>As a general statement, most sentences with an object are about the subject applying the verb to the object.<p>Here, soweli (furry animal) applies moku (eating) to kili kiwen (hard fruit or vegetable) and to kasi (plants)<p>Breaking it down like that, this "apply" idea is very simple. But the trick is that this, too, works with essentially any word.<p>If I say something silly, like<blockquote><p>mi kala e sina.</blockquote><p>kala means "fish," so this could mean "I turn you into a fish" or "I hit you with a fish." If you're playing fast and loose, it could be "I give you flippers", or "I push you into a pool"- those <em>kinda</em> make you like a fish, even if they're a bit more silly.<p>The point is, all of these things loosely mean "apply kala, fish, to you"<p>Of course, most verbs applied to objects will mean more usual things, just because usual things... are more usual.<p>So let's look at a more usual case.<blockquote><p>sina pona e pilin mi, "You helped my feelings," "you improved my mood."</blockquote><p>Here, "pilin mi", my feelings, become "pona," good. Because of sina, "you."<p>And after this, we could say:<blockquote><p>pilin mi li pona. "My feelings are good." "My vibe is positive."</blockquote><p>Here's another one:<blockquote><p>jan seme li jaki e tomo?! Who tracked mud in the house?! Who threw garbage in the office??</blockquote><p>And after this, we can say "tomo li jaki." The building is dirty.<p>Now, some sentences aren't going to actually change the object- just involve it in some action the subject does. Your intuition about the action itself will help you here, so I'll demonstrate this more quickly:<blockquote><p>pipi li wile e seme? the bug wants what?</blockquote><blockquote><p>ona suwi li lukin e sina, "the cute one is looking at you!" ... oh yeah! you can modify pronouns!</blockquote><p>In case you didn't catch it, seme can go in the object too.<h1 id=summary>Summary</h1><p>And that's the presentation!<p>Here's a list of every topic, just to remind you of how much ground we covered:<ul><li>Words are super broad, like the english word fruit, but even bigger.<li>The grammar is broad too- "doing" and "being" are the same thing, nouns don't tell you number, and verbs don't tell you when something happens.<li>The basic pronouns are mi, "I, me, we", sina: "you, "y'all", and ona: "she, it, they, he." There's also "ni", "this, that, these, those."<li>The word li is marks the start of a verb for any subject besides mi or sina. mi or sina are special and don't need it because we say them lots.<li>You can ask questions in three different ways: doubling the first word of the verb and putting ala between them, adding anu seme to the end of the sentence, or putting seme in place of something you don't know.<li>You can answer the first two types of questions with the first word of the verb for yes, or ala for no. And you can answer seme questions with anything by filling in the blank!<li>And lastly, the word e marks the start of an object, and means the subject is doing something to or with that object.</ul><h1 id=resources>Resources</h1><ul><li>First, here's another type of getting started lesson, but one of a different style: ilo Tani created the video "toki pona in 18 minutes," and it has the goal of covering absolutely everything you need, but very briefly. It's a great way to put all the ideas in your head right away.<li>Next, here's several online lessons:<ul><li>lipu sona pona, by jan Lentan, is an older but still very helpful course- I did some of my own learning from it.<li>o pilin e toki pona is a full-immersion course by jan Telakoman, and helpful even if you've completed other lessons!<li><li></ul><li>And two online resources:<ul><li>there is a dictionary called lipu Linku at linku.la,<li>and</ul></ul><!-- # What did I gloss over? --></article><footer><h2 class=tokipona>o toki tawa mi</h2><p><a href=https://youtube.com/@gregdan3d><img src=/buttons/youtube.gif alt="@gregdan3d on YouTube"> </a><a href=https://github.com/gregdan3><img src=/buttons/github.gif alt="@gregdan3 on GitHub"> </a><a href=https://discord.com/users/497549183847497739><img src=/buttons/discord.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Discord"> </a><a href=https://gregdan3.t.me/ ><img src=/buttons/telegram.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Telegram"></a><p>Generated by my <a href=https://github.com/gregdan3/SWGIG>Static Website Generator I Guess</a>.
