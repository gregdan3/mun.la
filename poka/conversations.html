I’m not going to cover everything- I can’t- but I’ll cover enough to get you started, and shoutout some resources at the end to help you keep going!</p> <p>We are going to briefly discuss all of the following:</p> <ul> <li>sitelen pona</li> <li>pronouns</li> <li>basic sentences</li> <li>modifiers</li> <li>asking and answering questions</li> <li>a bit of interjections</li> <li>preverbs</li> </ul> <p>This leaves a <em>lot</em> on the cutting room floor, including commands and instructions, context, prepositions, preverbs, semantic spaces, names, numbers, the list of words and their meanings, and certainly more. Not to mention, I’m only going over each of these topics briefly.</p> <p>But don’t worry: at the end of this talk, you <em>will</em> be able to ask where the bathroom is. And this will be completely useless, because most Toki Pona is spoken on the internet! Let’s get started.</p> <h1 id=how-words-work>How Words Work</h1> <p>In Toki Pona, words are broad. Like, really broad. Imagine the English word fruit for example: it doesn’t mean “apple” or “banana” or “durian”, but it can refer to any of these. Toki Pona words all work like this: they “mean” some broad concept, but can refer to lots of specific things that fit into that concept.</p> <p>Let’s look at the name of the language to demonstrate how this works in Toki Pona:</p> <p>toki refers to speech, conversation, thought, and language. It’s not any one of these- it’s all of them, as one big idea-blob: communication, in all its forms.</p> <p>pona refers to things like positivity, being helpful, fixing things. Again, not any one of these, but all of them at once: positive qualities of all kinds.</p> <p>But together, “toki pona” can mean “friendly conversation”, “positive thought”, and of course “good language”.</p> <p>For time reasons, I’m not going to be defining each of the words as I go- I’ll give valid and helpful translations, but I’m going to be focusing mainly on the grammar, the really big concepts you need to get started. But as we go, keep the idea of words being really broad in mind- it will help with understanding!</p> <p>But before we get to more words, grammar, translations, we need to talk about these symbols!</p> <h1 id=sitelen-pona>sitelen pona</h1> <p>This here, that you’ve already seen, is the “logo” of sorts for Toki Pona. The circle with three lines over it is the word “toki”, and the smile-like line on the inside is the word “pona”.</p> <p>This way of writing is called “sitelen pona”, literally “good writing”, and it is toki pona’s most adorable writing system.</p> <p>sitelen pona is logographic, so each word has a symbol. Every symbol means exactly one word, and nearly all the words have exactly one symbol- we can pretend they’re all one to one for now. Lastly, each symbol is representative of the idea of the word! Uh, except for the grammar, then the symbol kinda looks like punctuation to my English-reading eyes.</p> <p>For this talk, all sitelen pona will be annotated with their pronunciation, but I encourage you to start in the language alongside the sitelen pona!</p> <p>Alright, <em>now</em> we can actually start on the language.</p> <h1 id=mi-and-sina-and-ona>mi and sina and ona</h1> <p>mi, sina, and ona are toki pona’s pronouns, and you’ll be using them a lot! In fact, you’ll use mi and sina so much, that they’re a little different from other subjects.</p> <p>Let’s look at some sentences. These first few will have just a subject and a verb:</p> <blockquote> <p>mi pona, “I am well” or “We are good”. mi is a first person pronoun: I, we, me.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>sina suwi, “You are cute”, or “Y’all are adorable”. sina is a second person pronoun: you, y’all.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>ona li sona, “They understand”, or “They know”. ona is a third person pronoun: they, it, he, she.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the first two sentences, mi and sina are the subject adn are immediately followed by a verb- the action of the sentence. This is always the case: if mi and sina are the exact subject, the verb always comes next.</p> <p>But in the third, ona is followed by the word “li”. For ona, and all other subjects <em>besides</em> mi and sina, li goes afterward and marks the start of the verb.</p> <p>mi and sina are special because doing it this way is a little more natural, and a little more comfortable to say.</p> <p>Otherwise, these are all the same kind of sentence: a subject, then a verb. Let’s look at a few more:</p> <blockquote> <p>mi lape, “I rested”, “I slept”, “I will relax”</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>sina kute, “You listened”, “y’all will listen”</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>ona li suli, “It was tall”, “She will be important”</p> </blockquote> <p>Bonus pronoun: We also have “ni”, a demonstrative pronoun, which is drawn like an arrow. Here’s a few sentences:</p> <blockquote> <p>ni li nasa, “That was strange”, “Those are unusual”</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>ni li wawa, “This is amazing”, “That is forceful”, “These are powerful”</p> </blockquote> <p>li makes a return, marking the verb for us. Fun fact: It’s a lot easier to tell part “mi pona” and “ni li pona” because of the grammatical difference, the use of the word li in one and not the other!</p> <p>So now, we have a handle on the pronouns. We can talk about ourselves, things, mostly by pointing.</p> <h1 id=modifiers>Modifiers</h1> <p>Next, we’re gonna look at modifiers. You might know them better as adjectives- same thing, but for every part of speech.</p> <p>The first word of a phrase is called the head, and is the most important part of knowing what is being talked about- just like the sentences we’ve already looked at. Modifiers can’t change what the thing is, with exactly one exception we’ll get to soon. But they can provide extra very helpful information in understanding what something is, or telling apart multiple similar things. Here’s some example sentences:</p> <blockquote> <p>ni li akesi lili, “this is a small frog”, “this is a tiny snake”</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>jan ni li kama, “this person has arrived”, “those people are coming”</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>kiwen jelo loje li pakala, “The yellow and red rock is broken”.</p> </blockquote> <h1 id=your-first-question>Your first question</h1> <p>In Toki Pona, questions are expressed with the grammar, and they have three forms. Let’s look at each:</p> <blockquote> <p>ona li lukin ala lukin?, “Is he looking?”, or “Are they staring?”</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>ni li lipu ala lipu?, “Is this a piece of paper?” or “Is that a leaf?”</p> </blockquote> <p>This type of question takes the first word of the verb, doubles it, and puts “ala” between them. You could translate that first question more literally as “Is he looking or not looking?”</p> <p>This is a yes or no question, except there is no “yes” and no “no”. Instead, you repeat the verb for yes, so to that first question we could say “lukin.”, meaning “Looking”. Or, you can say “ala” or “lukin ala”, “not looking.” And for the second question, we would say “lipu” for yes, or “ala.” or “lipu ala” for no.</p> <p>Here’s the next type of question, and it’s even easier:</p> <blockquote> <p>sina musi anu seme?, “Are you having fun?” “Are you funny?”</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>mi ante anu seme?, “Am I different?” “Am I changed?”</p> </blockquote> <p>This is also a yes-no question, and you answer the same way, although the grammar is a little more open-ended, so some speakers with respond with “ni” to confirm the entire statement, rather than repeat the first verb. The meaning is the same either way.</p> <h1 id=what-did-i-gloss-over>What did I gloss over?</h1> <p>Something you might have noticed but I didn’t draw attention to, was that toki pona words are very broad. All the words are plural or singular or whatever else- they don’t mark number. All words can refer to the present, the past, the future, whenever you want- they don’t mark time either. This means something like “mi” can refer to just yourself, or you and a friend, or a whole team that includes you. And it means that</p> <p>For those who know their grammar terms, there are no conjugations or declensions- no inflection whatsoever. If you learn a word, you can use that word.</p> </article> <footer> <p>Licensed under <a href=/LICENSE.txt>GPLv3</a>.</p> <p> Code on <a href=https://github.com/janKekanSan/jankekansan.github.io>my GitHub</a>. </p> </footer> <script src=/sptoggle.js></script> <script data-goatcounter=https://jankekansan.goatcounter.com/count async src=//gc.zgo.at/count.js></script> </body> </html>
