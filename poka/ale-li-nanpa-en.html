I’m gregdan3. I want to show you something strange!</p> <hr> <p>Everything is numbers. If you’re a thing, you’re numbers.</p> <p>Why is this? Many things make this possible.</p> <p>I’ll tell you!</p> <hr> <p>You heard me right: You’re numbers. So, you’re in a computer!</p> <p>But maybe you don’t agree, because…</p> <hr> <p>There are so many things. A computer can’t have every thing… Right?</p> <p>It can. Because…</p> <hr> <p>In a computer, a thing can go away if you’re not near it.</p> <p>Also, really tiny things, even the tiniest things, don’t have to be there all the time.</p> <p>Because of these, a computer doesn’t have to think about a whole big place, or all the tiny things.</p> <p>The computer can show you only the big things near you.</p> <p>The little things make the big things, so in the computer, only the big things are there most of the time!</p> <hr> <p>This is easy work, so it’s good for the computer. But it looks the same to your eyes!</p> <p>So if you understand this, maybe you want to ask:</p> <hr> <p>What makes everything numbers?</p> <hr> <p>First, can places and people be in computers?</p> <p>Like I said, places are not important. Your brain is way harder for a computer than a place!</p> <p>People’s brains do a lot, and have a LOT of things. And, lots of those things can’t go away, right? They’re important to people, to you!</p> <p>Can brains be in computers?</p> <p>Many people believe your brain is real. It doesn’t live somewhere else, even a little. Because of this, a computer could understand it completely, and then your brain could be inside the computer.</p> <p>In other words, the thing that makes you is in your head- your brain.</p> <p>If the computer can understand all of your brain, it can have you inside it.</p> <hr> <p>Second, are computers going to keep getting better over time?</p> <p>We know that places and people could be inside computers if the computer could know them completely.</p> <p>I also said that the computer can understand your whole brain if your brain is real and you.</p> <p>But are computers good enough to do this?</p> <p>There are lots of things in your brain. While I’m saying this, computers can’t understand your whole brain.</p> <p>But over a long time, computers will get better.</p> <p>We’ve seen over a long time that computers get two times as good every two years.</p> <p>If this stays true over a longer time, a computer will be able to do anything.</p> <p>So, a brain won’t be a big deal to a computer.</p> <p>It could have you, and other people, and lots of things inside!</p> <hr> <p>Third, will people a long time from now want to put people inside computers?</p> <p>You can’t know how things will be in a long enough time. You can’t know how the people then will feel.</p> <p>But, you can look at people right now, and know this about them:</p> <p>People now want to know about the people from a long time ago. Right now, we can’t put people in computers, but we are trying to know about the people from a long time ago!</p> <p>If people could be in computers, the people of today would want to learn about the people of the past using computers!</p> <p>So, people today probably would want to put people in computers, to learn.</p> <p>If this want lasts a long time, the people a long time from now will also want to put people in computers.</p> <p>And if they do this, they will do it a lot, so they can learn a lot!</p> <hr> <p>I’ve said a lot so far. Let’s go back over the important stuff:</p> <ul> <li>If computers can understand the brain, then people can be inside computers.</li> <li>If computers keep getting better over time, brains will be able be inside computers.</li> <li>If people are around long enough to make really good computers, they will want to put people inside computers.</li> </ul> <p>Oh yeah, and if they put people inside computers, they put a lot of people in computers!</p> <p>If this all is true, then you need to know:</p> <hr> <p>How many people are in computers? How many people are not in computers?</p> <hr> <p>If one person a long time from now has a computer, they can put lots and lots of people in it.</p> <p>So, there are way more people in computers than not.</p> <p>So, are you in a computer? Are you numbers?</p> <p>There are so many more people in computers, that you have to be in a computer.</p> <p>The numbers say that you’re numbers.</p> <hr> <p>But. Maybe you still don’t agree.</p> <p>What would have to be true for you to not be numbers? Let’s look at that too.</p> <hr> <p>First, the thing that makes you could be somewhere else- not just inside your head. Then computers could never understand you.</p> <p>Second, computers may not become good enough. If they don’t, people can’t be inside computers, because brains will still be too much for them!</p> <hr> <p>Third, people may not be around long enough because of something really bad happening. If there aren’t people, they can’t put people inside computers.</p> <p>And last, if people are around long enough, they may not want to put people in computers. You can’t know what people will want a long time from now!</p> <hr> <p>This is a lot! But how important are they? To me, these aren’t important.</p> <hr> <p>The brain is a part of you, and you.</p> <p>Computers will keep getting better.</p> <p>People will still be around.</p> <p>And people will always want to learn!</p> <p>To me, things will be good, even in a long time.</p> <p>And many others feel the same!</p> <hr> <p>Now, maybe you think you’re in a computer, and that you’re numbers.</p> <p>Maybe you still don’t think so. You’re not numbers, you’re you!</p> <p>In any case, I want to tell you something important:</p> <p>Everything, and you, could be in a computer, could be numbers. You, and everything, could not be.</p> <p>That doesn’t matter!</p> <hr> <p>No matter what, you’re still here.</p> <p>You, and your friends, and your hard work, and your laughs, are all still here.</p> <p>Your still see, and hear, and feel.</p> <p>Love is still here, and still important.</p> <p>If you’re in a computer, or not, so what?</p> <p>If you’re numbers, or not, so what?</p> <p>You’re here.</p> <p>Keep caring about everyone close to you. And keep having fun!</p> <hr> <p>This talk is in Toki Pona, and in English, and is something new.</p> <p>I want to grow Toki Pona, so I made this in both languages!</p> <p>This way, many people will be able to follow along.</p> <p>Look at the other work too- it should be on a card right now!</p> <hr> <p>If you want to see more from me, subscribe, hit the bell, and learn Toki Pona!</p> <p>And let me know in the comments: Are you in a computer? Are you numbers?</p> <hr> <p>Thanks to jan Tekinowi for the front picture, and thanks to jan Sa for the words you can read!</p> <p>And last, thanks to you for watching and listening! Have a good one!</p> </article> <footer> <p>Licensed under <a href=/LICENSE.txt>GPLv3</a>.</p> <p> Code on <a href=https://github.com/janKekanSan/jankekansan.github.io>my GitHub</a>. </p> </footer> <script src=/sptoggle.js></script> <script data-goatcounter=https://jankekansan.goatcounter.com/count async src=//gc.zgo.at/count.js></script> </body> </html>
