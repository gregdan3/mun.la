I'm gregdan3. I want to show you something strange!<hr><p>Everything is numbers. If you're a thing, you're numbers.<p>Why is this? Many things make this possible.<p>I'll tell you!<hr><p>You heard me right: You're numbers. So, you're in a computer!<p>But maybe you don't agree, because...<hr><p>There are so many things. A computer can't have every thing... Right?<p>It can. Because...<hr><p>In a computer, a thing can go away if you're not near it.<p>Also, really tiny things, even the tiniest things, don't have to be there all the time.<p>Because of these, a computer doesn't have to think about a whole big place, or all the tiny things.<p>The computer can show you only the big things near you.<p>The little things make the big things, so in the computer, only the big things are there most of the time!<hr><p>This is easy work, so it's good for the computer. But it looks the same to your eyes!<p>So if you understand this, maybe you want to ask:<hr><p>What makes everything numbers?<hr><p>First, can places and people be in computers?<p>Like I said, places are not important. Your brain is way harder for a computer than a place!<p>People's brains do a lot, and have a LOT of things. And, lots of those things can't go away, right? They're important to people, to you!<p>Can brains be in computers?<p>Many people believe your brain is real. It doesn't live somewhere else, even a little. Because of this, a computer could understand it completely, and then your brain could be inside the computer.<p>In other words, the thing that makes you is in your head- your brain.<p>If the computer can understand all of your brain, it can have you inside it.<hr><p>Second, are computers going to keep getting better over time?<p>We know that places and people could be inside computers if the computer could know them completely.<p>I also said that the computer can understand your whole brain if your brain is real and you.<p>But are computers good enough to do this?<p>There are lots of things in your brain. While I'm saying this, computers can't understand your whole brain.<p>But over a long time, computers will get better.<p>We've seen over a long time that computers get two times as good every two years.<p>If this stays true over a longer time, a computer will be able to do anything.<p>So, a brain won't be a big deal to a computer.<p>It could have you, and other people, and lots of things inside!<hr><p>Third, will people a long time from now want to put people inside computers?<p>You can't know how things will be in a long enough time. You can't know how the people then will feel.<p>But, you can look at people right now, and know this about them:<p>People now want to know about the people from a long time ago. Right now, we can't put people in computers, but we are trying to know about the people from a long time ago!<p>If people could be in computers, the people of today would want to learn about the people of the past using computers!<p>So, people today probably would want to put people in computers, to learn.<p>If this want lasts a long time, the people a long time from now will also want to put people in computers.<p>And if they do this, they will do it a lot, so they can learn a lot!<hr><p>I've said a lot so far. Let's go back over the important stuff:<ul><li>If computers can understand the brain, then people can be inside computers.<li>If computers keep getting better over time, brains will be able be inside computers.<li>If people are around long enough to make really good computers, they will want to put people inside computers.</ul><p>Oh yeah, and if they put people inside computers, they put a lot of people in computers!<p>If this all is true, then you need to know:<hr><p>How many people are in computers? How many people are not in computers?<hr><p>If one person a long time from now has a computer, they can put lots and lots of people in it.<p>So, there are way more people in computers than not.<p>So, are you in a computer? Are you numbers?<p>There are so many more people in computers, that you have to be in a computer.<p>The numbers say that you're numbers.<hr><p>But. Maybe you still don't agree.<p>What would have to be true for you to not be numbers? Let's look at that too.<hr><p>First, the thing that makes you could be somewhere else- not just inside your head. Then computers could never understand you.<p>Second, computers may not become good enough. If they don't, people can't be inside computers, because brains will still be too much for them!<hr><p>Third, people may not be around long enough because of something really bad happening. If there aren't people, they can't put people inside computers.<p>And last, if people are around long enough, they may not want to put people in computers. You can't know what people will want a long time from now!<hr><p>This is a lot! But how important are they? To me, these aren't important.<hr><p>The brain is a part of you, and you.<p>Computers will keep getting better.<p>People will still be around.<p>And people will always want to learn!<p>To me, things will be good, even in a long time.<p>And many others feel the same!<hr><p>Now, maybe you think you're in a computer, and that you're numbers.<p>Maybe you still don't think so. You're not numbers, you're you!<p>In any case, I want to tell you something important:<p>Everything, and you, could be in a computer, could be numbers. You, and everything, could not be.<p>That doesn't matter!<hr><p>No matter what, you're still here.<p>You, and your friends, and your hard work, and your laughs, are all still here.<p>Your still see, and hear, and feel.<p>Love is still here, and still important.<p>If you're in a computer, or not, so what?<p>If you're numbers, or not, so what?<p>You're here.<p>Keep caring about everyone close to you. And keep having fun!<hr><p>This talk is in Toki Pona, and in English, and is something new.<p>I want to grow Toki Pona, so I made this in both languages!<p>This way, many people will be able to follow along.<p>Look at the other work too- it should be on a card right now!<hr><p>If you want to see more from me, subscribe, hit the bell, and learn Toki Pona!<p>And let me know in the comments: Are you in a computer? Are you numbers?<hr><p>Thanks to jan Tekinowi for the front picture, and thanks to jan Sa for the words you can read!<p>And last, thanks to you for watching and listening! Have a good one!</article><footer><h2 class=tokipona>o toki tawa mi</h2><p class=buttons style=display:block><a href=https://youtube.com/@gregdan3d><img src=/buttons/youtube.gif alt="@gregdan3d on YouTube"> </a><a href=https://github.com/gregdan3><img src=/buttons/github.gif alt="@gregdan3 on GitHub"> </a><a href=https://discord.com/users/497549183847497739><img src=/buttons/discord.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Discord"> </a><a href=https://gregdan3.t.me/ ><img src=/buttons/telegram.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Telegram"></a><p>Generated by my <a href=https://github.com/gregdan3/SWGIG>Static Website Generator I Guess</a>.
