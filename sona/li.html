While <span class=tokipona>li</span> is present, any word but <span class=tokipona>mi</span> and <span class=tokipona>sina</span> can be in the subject, and any word can be in the predicate like in last lesson. You'll find that the variety in Toki Pona words lets you say a lot, even with so few words!<details><summary>A note on "any word"</summary><p>I do say "any word", but clever observers will have noticed I am treating the word <span class=tokipona>li</span> differently. It is introduced as a particle, its definition is given in parentheses, and it is treated as a grammatical structure instead of as a word. This is because <span class=tokipona>li</span> cannot be used in the subject or predicate, with some subtle exceptions we'll get to later. For now, everything <em>else</em> can be in the subject or predicate.</details><p>Since using <span class=tokipona>li</span> lets you put any word in the subject, most of the words in the lesson before can now be used there! This leans heavily into the action/description duality described before. Unlike that duality, you can tell which sense a word is meant in based on its place in a sentence. Words in the subject are more likely to be specific objects or ideas, where words in the predicate are more likely to be actions or descriptions!<div class=warning><p>Remember, if the subject is <em>just</em> <span class=tokipona>mi</span> or <em>just</em> <span class=tokipona>sina</span>, do not include <span class=tokipona>li</span>!</div><p>Here's a guided example:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>mama li musi</span></summary><ul><li>Mom is hilarious.<li>Dad is being funny.<li>My parent is exciting!<li>My babysitter is amusing!<li>Grandpa joked!</ul></details><p>Here, the subject is <span class=tokipona>mama</span>, a parent or ancestor. Since the subject isn't <span class=tokipona>mi</span> or <span class=tokipona>sina</span>, <span class=tokipona>li</span> is present and starts the predicate. Then the predicate is <span class=tokipona>musi</span>, fun and entertainment. <span class=tokipona>musi</span> could be either a description or action here, and these cannot be told apart without more context- Toki Pona doesn't tell them apart! Check under the spoiler for possible interpretations.<h4 id=multiple-li>Multiple li</h4><p>To say a subject does more than one thing, you say <span class=tokipona>li</span> a second time at the end of the predicate, marking another predicate. Saying <span class=tokipona>li</span> multiple times is like saying "and" in English, but just for the predicate! Here's an example:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>kulupu li suli li pona</span></summary><ul><li>The community is huge, and wonderful!<li>The collection is enormous, and pretty!<li>The stack is tall, and fantastic!</ul></details><p>Here, the subject <span class=tokipona>kulupu</span> is doing two things: being <span class=tokipona>suli</span> (big) and being <span class=tokipona>pona</span> (good).<p>Using more than one <span class=tokipona>li</span> is the same as using two sentences with the same subject. This means we can restate the one sentence above as these two sentences, which have the same meaning together:<blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>kulupu li suli. kulupu li pona.</span></blockquote><p>Here's another example:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>jan li tawa li lape</span></summary><ul><li>The person walks, and goes to sleep.<li>The person walks, and sleeps.<li>Everyone is traveling, and sleeping.</ul></details><p>Here, <span class=tokipona>jan</span> is doing two different things: <span class=tokipona>tawa</span> (moving), and <span class=tokipona>lape</span> (sleeping). Toki Pona words don't mark time, so these two actions can happen at different times, but be described in one sentence without issue!<p>And again, this is the same as the following two sentences:<blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>jan li tawa. jan li lape.</span></blockquote><p>You can have as many predicates as you want, but try to keep your sentences shorter- shorter sentences are easier to understand.<div class=warning><p><span class=tokipona>mi</span> and <span class=tokipona>sina</span> do not use <span class=tokipona>li</span>, so you can't <em>normally</em> do this with them. Instead, use separate sentences: <span class=tokipona>mi tawa. mi lape.</span></div><h2 id=exercises>Exercises</h2><h3 id=toki-pona-to-english>Toki Pona to English</h3><h4 id=single-li>Single li</h4><p>You and a friend are looking through old photos.

Remember that the word before is the subject, and the word after describes what the subject <em>is</em> or <em>does</em>- respectively called the subject and predicate! You can think of <span class=tokipona>li</span> being similar to English "doing" or "being," but comparisons to other languages are no substitute for practice!<h4 id=back-to-misina>Back to mi/sina</h4><p>In the previous lesson, we covered a sentence which exclusively began with either <span class=tokipona>mi</span> or <span class=tokipona>sina</span>. In this lesson, we covered a sentence where anything can start the sentence- so long as it is followed by <span class=tokipona>li</span>. These are actually the same kind of sentence!<blockquote><p>[<span class=tokipona>mi</span>/<span class=tokipona>sina</span>] [predicate]</blockquote><blockquote><p>[subject] <span class=tokipona>li</span> [predicate]</blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>mi</span> and <span class=tokipona>sina</span> are just special subjects. Another way to think about this sentence is this: if the subject is <em>exactly</em> <span class=tokipona>mi</span> or <em>exactly</em> <span class=tokipona>sina</span>, don't include <span class=tokipona>li</span>. You can also think of it as though <span class=tokipona>mi</span> and <span class=tokipona>sina</span> <em>are</em> <span class=tokipona>li</span> for their kind of sentence. These different ways of looking at it are helpful tools, but don't let it get in the way of the language!<h4 id=content-words-and-particles>Content Words and Particles</h4><p>Any <em>meaningful</em> word may appear in either the subject, the predicate, or both at once. When I say "meaningful", this refers the idea of a <strong>content word</strong>, or a word which serves some <em>semantic</em> function instead of an exclusively grammatical one. The word <span class=tokipona>li</span> is only grammatical- it is not a content word. Every other word so far is a content word.<p>The word <span class=tokipona>li</span> is a <strong>particle</strong>, and is not the only one! We will learn about the rest in future lessons. What they have in common is having no semantic function- no meaning.<p>There are also a handful of words which are so-called <strong>pseudo-particles</strong>. This category is more blurry, but it contains words which have functions as particles <em>and</em> as content words. Again, we'll learn about those in a future lesson!<hr><div class=info><p>There's no better time to start practicing than right now!
