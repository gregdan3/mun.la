Instead, we'll be looking at a bunch of words from before in new ways.</p><h2 id=overview>Overview</h2><h4 id=interjections>Interjections</h4><p>In Toki Pona, there are many things to say that are not complete sentences: interjections! <span class=tokipona>toki</span> says "hello", and a subject plus <span class=tokipona>o</span> gets that subject's attention. But there's more!</p><p>Anything that can be a subject, predicate, object, or preposition with prep phrase can be an interjection! Some of these can even be used together.</p><p>But some words and phrases do better than others. To make this point, I've broken down interjections into a few common uses.</p><p>Before we start, let's talk about <span class=tokipona>a</span>!</p><h4 id=a-the-interjection-that-ever>a, the interjection that ever</h4><p><span class=tokipona>a</span> is a special word. It has no meaning like particles, but it also doesn't do anything to a sentence. It's just <span class=tokipona>a</span>, and you use it to express your feelings! As a modifier, it makes the thing it modifies more intense like the word "very" in English. As an interjection, it works like a lot of wordless responses, such as "um," "oh," and "ah."</p><p>Since <span class=tokipona>a</span> can be used so many ways, we'll look at a few examples to get a feel for it:</p><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>mi kama jo e lipu a</span></p><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>a!</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><details class=details><summary class=summary>See Translation!</summary><p>1: I got a cool book!</p><p>2: Ooooh! [excitement]</p></details><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>soweli mi li weka a</span></p><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>a...</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><details class=details><summary class=summary>See Translation!</summary><p>1: My dog ran away...</p><p>2: Oh... [empathy]</p></details><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>mi sona ala a e toki sina</span></p><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>a...</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><details class=details><summary class=summary>See Translation!</summary><p>1: I <em>really</em> don't understand what you're saying</p><p>2: Hmmm... [thinking]</p></details><p>For all of these, the tone is important! Not everyone's tone will be the same when speaking, either. But this is far from everything that <span class=tokipona>a</span> can do. Try lots of things!</p><div class=info><p>Sometimes you'll hear "<strong>nnn</strong>" instead of "<strong>aaa</strong>". This comes from the word <span class=tokipona>n</span>, which works like "hmm" or "uh" in English! It's less common than <span class=tokipona>a</span>, so it is not in this lesson, but you may see and hear it around.</p></div><h4 id=o-alikes-well-wishes>o-alikes / well-wishes</h4><p><span class=tokipona>o</span>-alikes are similar to instructions given with <span class=tokipona>o</span>, but without <span class=tokipona>o</span>. You could call them "well-wishes", because the most common of these end in or have <span class=tokipona>pona</span>! Some examples:</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>tawa pona</span></summary><p>Go well!</p><p>Be happy as you leave!</p></details><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>musi pona</span></summary><p>Have fun!</p><p>Be happy as you play!</p></details><p>These two are similar: Do something in a good way! You could see these used in response to goodbyes, for example, but there are many more with different uses.</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>pona tawa sina</span></summary><p>Goodness, go to you!</p><p>Peace be upon you!</p></details><p>This one is also a well-wish, but includes the preposition <span class=tokipona>tawa</span>.</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>moli pona</span></summary><p>Die well!</p><p>Have a good death!</p></details><p>This one is a bit joking- I use this myself when I beat somebody in a videogame!</p><p>You can choose to include <span class=tokipona>o</span> where it makes sense, making these complete sentences while keeping the well-wishing meaning:</p><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>o tawa pona</span></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>o musi pona</span></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>pona o tawa sina</span></p></blockquote><p>These versions could be instructions or well wishes- but they have similar meanings with or without <span class=tokipona>o</span>. It's all about context!</p><p>Try lots of different things! Experimenting is key to speaking Toki Pona.</p><p>Here's an example exchange to fit the idea in a conversation:</p><blockquote><p>1: <span class=tokipona>mi tawa</span></p><blockquote><p>2: <span class=tokipona>tawa pona</span></p><blockquote><p>1: <span class=tokipona>a! awen pona</span></p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><details class=details><summary class=summary>See Translation!</summary><p>1: I'm going!</p><p>2: Go well!</p><p>1: Yeah! Stay well!</p><hr><p>The above is a literal translation, so here is a comparable conversation but written in more natural English:</p><p>1: I'm headed out!</p><p>2: See you later!</p><p>1: Yeah! See you!</p></details><h4 id=feelings-opinions-and-remarks>Feelings, Opinions, and Remarks</h4><p>Most other interjections are specific words! Their meaning as an interjection comes from what the word normally means. We already saw that <span class=tokipona>a</span> can be used for any feeling, but words like <span class=tokipona>sona, wawa, musi,</span> and others can do specific feelings: Excitement, interest, happiness, fear, anger, sadness, and everything between!</p><p>These can also be used to express how you feel about a situation, similar to saying "<span class=tokipona>ni li</span> [word]", or "<span class=tokipona>pilin mi li</span> [word]". They're great for using in a conversation!</p><p>Here's a bunch of common use examples. This is not a complete list, and it doesn't cover every way you could use these words. But it does cover a lot of common uses. Try lots of things!</p><hr><p><span class=tokipona>pona</span> interjection is to express that something is good! It works like "great", "cool" or "nice" in English.</p><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>o pali e ni</span></p><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>a! mi pali</span></p><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>pona</span></p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><details class=details><summary class=summary>See Translation!</summary><p>1: Can you make this?</p><p>2: Yeah, I'll make it</p><p>1: Great, thanks!</p></details><hr><p><span class=tokipona>ike</span> interjection is like saying "oh no" or "oof" in English, expressing your dislike for something.</p><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>mi ken ala kute e jan poka tan kalama suli... ike!</span></p></blockquote><details class=details><summary class=summary>See Translation!</summary><p>I can't hear the person beside me because of all the loud noise.

Crap!</p></details><hr><p><span class=tokipona>musi</span> interjection is used to express excitement or humor! It can express the same feeling as laughter, but laughter itself is usually written with <span class=tokipona>a a a</span></p><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>jan tomo li toki e ni: mi pana ala tawa jan pi tawa tenpo... jan pi tawa tenpo li tawa tomo pi telo nasa.</span></p><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>musi! a a a</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><details class=details><summary class=summary>See Translation!</summary><p>1: "The bartender says this: I don't serve time travellers!

But these are all different- they express different things about how the speaker feels!</p></div><p><span class=tokipona>mu</span> is Toki Pona's word for any animal sound- as an interjection, it tells you the speaker is having fun!</p><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>mu</span></p></blockquote><hr><p>Remember: this is not a complete list, but many examples.
