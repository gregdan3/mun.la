The subject does something, and the predicate is what they do!</p><blockquote><p>[subject] [predicate]</p></blockquote><p>For this kind of sentence, two subjects are possible:</p><ul><li><span class=tp>mi</span> - First person pronoun. I, me, my, mine, we, our, myself, ourselves</li><li><span class=tp>sina</span> - Second person pronoun. You, yours, yourself, y'all, y'all's</li></ul><p>So the Toki Pona sentence always looks like this:</p><blockquote><p>[<span class=tp>mi</span>/<span class=tp>sina</span>] [predicate]</p></blockquote><p>The English interpretation looks like this for <span class=tp>mi</span>:</p><blockquote><p>I am [description]</p><p>I [action]</p><p>We are [description]</p><p>We [action]</p></blockquote><p>You'll notice these refer to just you as "I", or to a group of you as "we." In Toki Pona, words are broad in meaning- number doesn't change that. Keep an eye out for words being broad in the future!</p><p>Then, here are the English interpretations for <span class=tp>sina</span>:</p><blockquote><p>You are [description]</p><p>You [action]</p><p>Y'all are [description]</p><p>Y'all [action]</p></blockquote><p>For all of these examples, the predicate is either an action or a description- that is, what the subject is doing, or what the subject is! Here are more examples:</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tp>mi jan</span> (click for the translation!)</summary><p>Since <span class=tp>jan</span> (person/people) isn't clearly an action, we translate it as a description. This sentence means "<strong>I am a person</strong>" or "<strong>We are people.</strong>"</p></details><p><span class=tp>mi</span> is the subject, and refers to the speaker. <span class=tp>jan</span> is the predicate, and is either an action or description of the speaker. Check your understanding under the spoiler by clicking it!</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tp>sina moku</span></summary><p>Because <span class=tp>moku</span> (food/eat) could be either a description or an action, this sentence could be "<strong>You eat</strong>" or "<strong>You are food.</strong>" Both are valid!</p><p>But even though this sentence <em>could</em> mean either one, "<strong>You eat</strong>" is a more common and more reasonable meaning than "<strong>You are food.</strong>" When translating, keep that "reasonable" point in mind!</p></details><p><span class=tp>sina</span> is the subject, and refers to the listener. <span class=tp>moku</span> is the predicate, and is either an action or description of the listener. Again, check your understanding under the spoiler!</p><h3 id=words-and-context>Words and Context</h3><p>We saw that <span class=tp>mi</span> can be used like "I" or like "we," and we'll see it work like "my" and "myself" and "our" in future lessons! We also saw that the predicate can be an action, or a description- putting it another way, Toki Pona doesn't tell you the difference between "being red" and "redding," the act of being red! Here's the bigger picture:</p><ul><li><strong>Words don't mark number!</strong> <span class=tp>jan</span> may talk about one person, fourteen people, everyone in a city, a hypothetical person, and more.</li><li><strong>Words don't mark time!</strong> <span class=tp>moku</span> may talk about eating right now, going out to eat next week, drinking months ago, and anything else.</li><li><strong>Words don't mark gender!</strong> <span class=tp>mama</span> can any parent, guardian, or ancestor, regardless of gender.</li></ul><p>Other languages put this information into the words or grammar. In Toki Pona, that information is only in context: Who said this, and when? The words don't change- just the context does!</p><p>Keep this in mind, and try to think of as many ways to translate these sentences as you can. Remember: you can change number, time, gender, and even the specific action or description- as long as it matches the word!</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tp>mi lape</span></summary><ul><li>I slept.</li><li>I'm sleeping.</li><li>I was relaxing.</li><li>I'm taking a nap.</li><li>I'm going to sleep.</li><li>We're asleep.</li><li>We're going to rest.</li><li>We're about to sleep!</li></ul></details><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tp>sina tawa</span></summary><ul><li>You're walking</li><li>You jogged</li><li>You will sprint</li><li>You will have run</li><li>You ran away!</li><li>You're leaving</li><li>You left</li><li>You logged out</li><li>You flew!</li></ul></details><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tp>sina mama</span></summary><ul><li>You're a parent!</li><li>You're a mom!</li><li>You're a dad.</li><li>Y'all are parents.</li><li>You'll babysit.</li><li>Y'all babysat.</li><li>You’ve been a babysitter.</li><li>You're a parental figure.</li><li>You have parented before.</li></ul></details><p>Tip: You can translate these sentences in <strong>dozens</strong> of ways, especially with appropriate context- you might even think of something that isn't listed!</p><h3 id=hello-and-goodbye>Hello and Goodbye</h3><p>In Toki Pona, there are no specific words for "hello" or "goodbye."</p><p>Instead, "hello" is part of the word <span class=tp>toki</span>. It covers every kind of greeting!</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tp>toki</span></summary><ul><li>Hello!</li><li>Hi!</li><li>Hey!</li><li>'sup!</li><li>Howdy!</li><li>G'day!</li><li>Good morning!</li><li>Good afternoon!</li><li>Good evening!</li></ul></details><p>That's it! If you're starting a conversation with somebody, hit 'em with a <span class=tp>toki</span>!</p><p>But saying "goodbye" is a bit different. To say goodbye, you describe how you're leaving: by moving!</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tp>mi tawa</span></summary><ul><li>I'm leaving</li><li>I'm going</li><li>I'm traveling</li><li>I'm walking</li><li>I'm moving</li><li>I'm logging off!</li><li>Bye! (non-literal)</li></ul></details><p>This is the most common way to say goodbye in Toki Pona, but it isn't the only one. I'll point out more in future lessons!</p><hr><h2 id=exercises>Exercises</h2><p>Try to figure out what these statements mean in English, then check your answer under the spoiler! The first answer is the one that best fits the given context, and the rest are other ways that sentence could be understood, but in different contexts.</p><p>All Toki Pona to English exercises include some situation as context, because language lives in context! Toki Pona is no exception. Knowing <em>when</em> a sentence is said helps you understand <em>why</em> it was said, and thus what it means.</p><h3 id=i-and-we>I and we</h3><p>You're about to go up to the podium on stage and give a speech.

Still, you probably could follow that conversation anyway!</p><h3 id=what-did-you-learn>What did you learn?</h3><p>In Toki Pona, a sentence could be understood many different ways, depending on when it's said! And there are two reasons for that:</p><p><strong>Toki Pona words are broad in meaning</strong></p><p>In Toki Pona, words don't tell you about number, time, or gender. They also don't care if they're being used as a verb or adjective, or anything else. Because of that, each word can have a huge number of possible meanings.</p><p>Instead of changing the words to tell you about time or number, Toki Pona lets you figure things out from context- or spell it out literally, as we'll learn later!</p><p><strong>Actions and descriptions are the same thing</strong></p><p>In Toki Pona, there is no grammatical difference between "doing" and "being." The predicate does both! To describe it in English, you could say that if a person walks, they are also a walking person.</p><p>Bu this is better understood in Toki Pona: You might assume that <span class=tp>mi tawa</span> means "I'm walking" or maybe "I'm leaving." But it could just as easily mean "I am being shaken!"</p><hr><div class=info><p>You've made it through your first full lesson!
