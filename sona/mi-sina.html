The subject does something, and the predicate is what they do! To start, we'll only have one word in each, so here's an example:</p><blockquote><p><span class=tp lang=tok><span class=h1>mi</span> <span class=h2>toki</span></span></p></blockquote><p>This kind of sentence can start with <span class=tp lang=tok>mi</span> (mi) to mean "I", or <span class=tp lang=tok>sina</span> (sina) to mean "you". Every sentence in this lesson will be one of these, so they'll always look like this:</p><blockquote><p>[<span class=tp lang=tok>mi</span>/<span class=tp lang=tok>sina</span>] [predicate]</p></blockquote><p>If a sentence starts with <span class=tp lang=tok>mi</span>, you could read it in any of these ways:</p><blockquote><p>I am [description]</p><p>I [action]</p><p>We are [description]</p><p>We [action]</p></blockquote><p>You'll notice that <span class=tp lang=tok>mi</span> can be translated as "I" or "we"- it can be singular or plural, even though the word didn't change. In Toki Pona, words can refer to any number of people or things!</p><p>Then, if a sentence started with <span class=tp lang=tok>sina</span>, you could read it in any of these ways:</p><blockquote><p>You are [description]</p><p>You [action]</p><p>Y'all are [description]</p><p>Y'all [action]</p></blockquote><p>In all of these examples, the predicate is either an action or a description- either what the subject is doing, or what the subject is! Keep that in mind, and try to translate this sentence:</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tp lang=tok><span class=h1>mi</span> <span class=h2>jan</span></span> (click for the translation!)</summary><p>Since <span class=tp lang=tok>jan</span> (person/people) doesn't make much sense as an action, we translate it as a description. This sentence means "<strong><span class=h1>I</span> am a <span class=h2>person</span></strong>" or "<strong><span class=h1>We</span> are <span class=h2>people</span>.</strong>"</p></details><p><span class=tp lang=tok>mi</span> is the <span class=h1>subject</span>, and refers to the speaker. <span class=tp lang=tok>jan</span> is the <span class=h2>predicate</span>, and is either an action or description of the speaker. Check your understanding under the spoiler by clicking it!</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tp lang=tok><span class=h1>sina</span> <span class=h2>moku</span></span></summary><p>Because <span class=tp lang=tok>moku</span> (food/eat) could be either a description or an action, this sentence could be "<strong>You eat</strong>" or "<strong>You are food.</strong>" Both are valid!</p><p>But even though this sentence <em>could</em> mean either one, "<strong>You eat</strong>" is a more common and more reasonable meaning than "<strong>You are food.</strong>" When translating, keep that "reasonable" point in mind!</p></details><p><span class=tp lang=tok>sina</span> is the <span class=h1>subject</span>, and refers to the listener. <span class=tp lang=tok>moku</span> is the <span class=h2>predicate</span>, and is either an action or description of the listener. Again, check your understanding under the spoiler!</p><h3 id=words-and-context>Words and Context</h3><p>We saw that <span class=tp lang=tok>mi</span> can be used like "I" or like "we," and we'll see it work like "my" and "myself" and "our" in future lessons! The same goes for <span class=tp lang=tok>sina</span>, which is used for "you" or "y'all", and will mean "yours" or "yourself" in future lessons.</p><p>Each word can take on so many different meanings because Toki Pona words mean different things in different contexts! And plurality isn't the only thing that can change. In the previous section, we saw that the predicate can be an action or a description- putting it another way, Toki Pona doesn't tell you the difference between "being red" and "redding," the act of being red! Here's the bigger picture:</p><ul><li><strong>Words don't mark number!</strong> <span class=tp lang=tok>jan</span> may talk about one person, fourteen people, everyone in a city, a hypothetical person, and more.</li><li><strong>Words don't mark time!</strong> <span class=tp lang=tok>moku</span> may talk about eating right now, going out to eat next week, drinking months ago, and anything else.</li><li><strong>Words don't mark gender!</strong> <span class=tp lang=tok>mama</span> can be any parent, guardian, or ancestor, regardless of gender.</li></ul><p>Other languages put this information into the way words are said, or into the grammar of the sentence. In Toki Pona, you'd either say that information with words, or leave it to context: Who said this, and when? The words don't change- but the context does!</p><p>To practice this idea, try to think of as many ways to translate these sentences as you can. Remember: you can change number, time, gender, and even the specific action or description- as long as it fits into the meaning of the word!</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tp lang=tok>mi lape</span></summary><ul><li>I slept.</li><li>I'm sleeping.</li><li>I was relaxing.</li><li>I'm taking a nap.</li><li>I'm going to sleep.</li><li>We're asleep.</li><li>We're going to rest.</li><li>We're about to sleep!</li></ul></details><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tp lang=tok>sina tawa</span></summary><ul><li>You're walking</li><li>You jogged</li><li>You will sprint</li><li>You will have run</li><li>You ran away!</li><li>You're leaving</li><li>You left</li><li>You logged out</li><li>You crawled!</li><li>You're shaking!</li></ul></details><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tp lang=tok>sina mama</span></summary><ul><li>You're a parent!</li><li>You're a mom!</li><li>You're a dad.</li><li>Y'all are parents.</li><li>You'll babysit.</li><li>Y'all babysat.</li><li>You’ve been a babysitter.</li><li>You're a parental figure.</li><li>You have parented before.</li></ul></details><p>Tip: You can translate these sentences in <strong>dozens</strong> of ways, especially with appropriate context- you'll probably think of something that isn't listed!</p><h3 id=your-first-question>Your First Question</h3><p>No language is complete without questions, and Toki Pona is no different! There are three ways to ask questions in Toki Pona, but we'll focus on the simplest for this lesson: <strong>Yes or no questions!</strong></p><p>To ask a yes or no question, you double the first word of the <span class=h2>predicate</span>, then put <span class=tp lang=tok><strong>ala</strong></span> (ala) in between. Here's an example:</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tp lang=tok><span class=h1>sina</span> <span class=h2>pona ala pona</span>?</span></summary><ul><li>Are you okay?</li><li>Are you well?</li><li>Are you alright?</li><li>Are you hurt?</li><li>You good or not good?</li></ul><div class=info><p>The above translations are more literal, while the ones below are made to make more sense in English. All of these are ways you might <em>translate</em> this sentence, but the meaning in Toki Pona is what's most important!</p></div><ul><li>How are you?</li><li>Doing okay?</li></ul></details><p>The <span class=h1>subject</span>, <span class=tp lang=tok>sina</span>, is exactly the same as before. But now, there's more going on in the predicate that turns it into a question! We'll see longer sentences in the future, but it's always that first word, doubled and with <span class=tp lang=tok>ala</span> between, which makes a statement into a question.</p><p>To answer a yes or no question, you can say an entire sentence back, or just repeat the true part of the predicate- in the above example, you'd say <span class=tp lang=tok>pona</span> for yes, or <span class=tp lang=tok>ala</span> for no.</p><p>You can think of yes or no questions as</p><h3 id=hello-and-goodbye>Hello and Goodbye</h3><p>In Toki Pona, there are no specific words for "hello" or "goodbye."</p><p>Instead, "hello" is part of the word <span class=tp lang=tok>toki</span>. It covers every kind of greeting!</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tp lang=tok>toki</span></summary><ul><li>Hello!</li><li>Hi!</li><li>Hey!</li><li>'sup!</li><li>Howdy!</li><li>G'day!</li><li>Good morning!</li><li>Good afternoon!</li><li>Good evening!</li></ul></details><p>That's it! If you're starting a conversation with somebody, hit 'em with a <span class=tp lang=tok>toki</span>!</p><p>But saying "goodbye" is a bit different. To say goodbye, you describe how you're leaving: by moving!</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tp lang=tok>mi tawa</span></summary><ul><li>I'm leaving</li><li>I'm going</li><li>I'm traveling</li><li>I'm walking</li><li>I'm moving</li><li>I'm logging off!</li><li>Bye! (non-literal)</li></ul></details><p>This is the most common way to say goodbye in Toki Pona, but it isn't the only one. I'll point out more in future lessons!</p><hr><h2 id=exercises>Exercises</h2><p>Try to translate these sentences to English, then check your understanding under the spoiler! The first answer fits the given context, but the rest are valid for other contexts.</p><p>All Toki Pona to English exercises include some situation as context, because language lives in context! Toki Pona is no exception. Knowing <em>when</em> a sentence is said helps you understand <em>why</em> it was said, and thus what it means.</p><h3 id=i-and-we>I and we</h3><p>You're about to go up to the podium on stage and give a speech.

And there are two reasons for that:</p><ol type=1><li>Toki Pona words are broad in meaning</li></ol><p>In Toki Pona, words don't tell you about number, time, or gender. They also don't care if they're being used as a verb or adjective, or anything else. Because of that, each word can have a huge number of possible meanings- a huge number of things they can refer to!</p><p>Instead of changing the words to tell you about time or number, Toki Pona lets you figure things out from context- or spell it out literally, as we'll learn later!</p><ol start=2 type=1><li>Actions and descriptions are the same thing</li></ol><p>In Toki Pona, there is no grammatical difference between "doing" and "being." The predicate does both! To describe it in English, you could say that if a person walks, they are also a walking person.</p><p>But this is better understood in Toki Pona: You might assume that <span class=tp lang=tok>mi tawa</span> means "I'm walking" or maybe "I'm leaving."
