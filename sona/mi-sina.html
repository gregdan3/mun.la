If you ever get lost, set "core words" and "widespread words" then search for what you need.</div><h2 id=overview>Overview</h2><h4 id=you-and-i>You and I</h4><p>The most basic Toki Pona sentence has two parts: a subject phrase and a predicate phrase.<blockquote><p>[subject] [predicate]</blockquote><p>For this kind of sentence, two subjects are possible<ul><li><span class=tokipona>mi</span> - First person pronoun. I, me, my, mine, we, our, myself, ourselves<li><span class=tokipona>sina</span> - Second person pronoun. You, yours, yourself, y'all, y'all's</ul><p>So the Toki Pona sentence always looks like this:<blockquote><p>[<span class=tokipona>mi</span>/<span class=tokipona>sina</span>] [predicate]</blockquote><p>The English interpretation looks like this for mi:<blockquote><p>I am [description]<p>I [action]<p>We are [description]<p>We [action]</blockquote><p>And this for sina:<blockquote><p>You are [description]<p>You [action]<p>Y'all are [description]<p>Y'all [action]</blockquote><p>The words in the predicate describe the speaker or listener, or what the speaker or listener is doing. For example:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>mi jan</span></summary><p>Since jan (person/people) doesn't obviously imply an action, it is reasonable to call it a description here. This sentence means "<strong>I am a person</strong>" or "<strong>We are people.</strong>"</details><p><span class=tokipona>mi</span> is the subject, and refers to the speaker. <span class=tokipona>jan</span> is the predicate, and is either an action or description of the speaker. Check under the spoiler for an explanation and interpretation!<details><summary><span class=tokipona>sina moku</span></summary><p>Because moku (food/eat) could be either a description or an action, this sentence could be "<strong>You eat</strong>" or "<strong>You are food.</strong>"<p>Importantly, "<strong>You eat</strong>" is <em>much</em> more likely and common than "<strong>You are food.</strong>" A sentence should be reasonable when you interpret it!</details><p><span class=tokipona>sina</span> is the subject, and refers to the listener. <span class=tokipona>moku</span> is the predicate, and is either an action or description of the listener.<h4 id=hello-and-goodbye>Hello and Goodbye</h4><p>In Toki Pona, there is no specific word for "hello" or for "goodbye."<p>Instead, "hello" is part of the word <span class=tokipona>toki</span>. It covers every kind of greeting!<details><summary><span class=tokipona>toki</span></summary><ul><li>Hello!<li>Good morning!<li>Hi!<li>Hey!</ul></details><p>And saying "goodbye" is to describe how you're leaving, by moving!<details><summary><span class=tokipona>mi tawa</span></summary><ul><li>I'm leaving<li>I'm going<li>I'm traveling<li>I'm walking<li>I'm moving</ul></details><p>This is the most common way to say "goodbye" in Toki Pona.<h2 id=exercises>Exercises</h2><div class=info><p>Translation is inexact!

This is intended! And it comes from two different effects:<h4 id=actiondescription-duality>Action/Description Duality</h4><p>As noted before, words in the predicate may be actions, descriptions, or both! In fact, often if something is an action, it is also a description. In English, you might say that if a person walks, they are also a walking person. Toki Pona runs with this idea. There is no difference between "doing" and "being" expressed by the grammar.<h4 id=broadness>Broadness</h4><p>Toki Pona words have broad meanings. <span class=tokipona>mi</span> does not refer to only yourself like "I" does. It can refer to a group including yourself like "we", an action on yourself like "myself", and something that belongs to you such as "mine" or "my"; all of these depend on context and place in a sentence. <span class=tokipona>sina</span> works the same way, and so do <em>all</em> Toki Pona words.<p>In short, words do not mark number! <span class=tokipona>jan</span> may talk about one person, four people, everyone in a city, and more.<p>Words do not mark time either! <span class=tokipona>moku</span> may talk about eating right now, eating in the near future, drinking in the distant past, becoming edible exactly a week from now, and anything else.<p>Broadness is part of the strength of Toki Pona. It is easier to navigate than you think! Context is everything, and understanding a sentence is much easier when you're experiencing what it describes.<p>A helpful strategy for understanding a sentence with less context is to consider how reasonable it is. For example, <span class=tokipona>mi moku</span> is able to mean "we are food", but it is more likely that <span class=tokipona>mi</span> is just the speaker, and <span class=tokipona>moku</span> is "eat". You can use this thinking to reason about sentences in the future.<h4 id=hello-and-goodbye-2>Hello and Goodbye</h4><p>As in one of the examples, which is <em>not</em> a sentence, you can say <span class=tokipona>toki</span> on its own to mean "hello!"<p>Another one of the examples is a sentence, and is the most common way to say goodbye: <span class=tokipona>mi tawa</span>, "I am leaving!"<hr><div class=info><p>Don't forget, you can toggle the glyphs back to familiar letters with the <strong>Toggle SP</strong> button!</div><p><a href=./open.html>Previous lesson</a><p><a href=./li.html>Next lesson</a></article><footer><h2 class=tokipona>o toki tawa mi</h2><p class=buttons style=display:block><a href=https://youtube.com/@gregdan3d><img src=/buttons/youtube.gif alt="@gregdan3d on YouTube"> </a><a href=https://github.com/gregdan3><img src=/buttons/github.gif alt="@gregdan3 on GitHub"> </a><a href=https://discord.com/users/497549183847497739><img src=/buttons/discord.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Discord"> </a><a href=https://gregdan3.t.me/ ><img src=/buttons/telegram.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Telegram"></a><p>Generated by my <a href=https://github.com/gregdan3/SWGIG>Static Website Generator I Guess</a>.
