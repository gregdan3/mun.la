I, me, my, mine, we, our, myself, ourselves</li><li><span class=tokipona>sina</span> - Second person pronoun. You, yours, yourself, y'all, y'all's</li></ul><p>So the Toki Pona sentence always looks like this:</p><blockquote><p>[<span class=tokipona>mi</span>/<span class=tokipona>sina</span>] [predicate]</p></blockquote><p>The English interpretation looks like this for mi:</p><blockquote><p>I am [description]</p><p>I [action]</p><p>We are [description]</p><p>We [action]</p></blockquote><p>And this for sina:</p><blockquote><p>You are [description]</p><p>You [action]</p><p>Y'all are [description]</p><p>Y'all [action]</p></blockquote><p>The words in the predicate describe the speaker or listener, or what the speaker or listener is doing. For example:</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>mi jan</span></summary><p>Since jan (person/people) doesn't obviously imply an action, it is reasonable to call it a description here. This sentence means "<strong>I am a person</strong>" or "<strong>We are people.</strong>"</p></details><p><span class=tokipona>mi</span> is the subject, and refers to the speaker. <span class=tokipona>jan</span> is the predicate, and is either an action or description of the speaker. Check under the spoiler for an explanation and interpretation!</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>sina moku</span></summary><p>Because moku (food/eat) could be either a description or an action, this sentence could be "<strong>You eat</strong>" or "<strong>You are food.</strong>"</p><p>Importantly, "<strong>You eat</strong>" is <em>much</em> more likely and common than "<strong>You are food.</strong>" A sentence should be reasonable when you interpret it!</p></details><p><span class=tokipona>sina</span> is the subject, and refers to the listener. <span class=tokipona>moku</span> is the predicate, and is either an action or description of the listener.</p><h4 id=hello-and-goodbye>Hello and Goodbye</h4><p>In Toki Pona, there is no specific word for "hello" or for "goodbye."</p><p>Instead, "hello" is part of the word <span class=tokipona>toki</span>. It covers every kind of greeting!</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>toki</span></summary><ul><li>Hello!</li><li>Good morning!</li><li>Hi!</li><li>Hey!</li></ul></details><p>And saying "goodbye" is to describe how you're leaving, by moving!</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>mi tawa</span></summary><ul><li>I'm leaving</li><li>I'm going</li><li>I'm traveling</li><li>I'm walking</li><li>I'm moving</li></ul></details><p>This is the most common way to say "goodbye" in Toki Pona.</p><h2 id=exercises>Exercises</h2><div class=info><p>Translation is inexact!

This is intended! And it comes from two different effects:</p><h4 id=actiondescription-duality>Action/Description Duality</h4><p>As noted before, words in the predicate may be actions, descriptions, or both! In fact, often if something is an action, it is also a description. In English, you might say that if a person walks, they are also a walking person. Toki Pona runs with this idea. There is no difference between "doing" and "being" expressed by the grammar.</p><h4 id=broadness>Broadness</h4><p>Toki Pona words have broad meanings. <span class=tokipona>mi</span> does not refer to only yourself like "I" does. It can refer to a group including yourself like "we", an action on yourself like "myself", and something that belongs to you such as "mine" or "my"; all of these depend on context and place in a sentence. <span class=tokipona>sina</span> works the same way, and so do <em>all</em> Toki Pona words.</p><p>In short, words do not mark number! <span class=tokipona>jan</span> may talk about one person, four people, everyone in a city, and more.</p><p>Words do not mark time either! <span class=tokipona>moku</span> may talk about eating right now, eating in the near future, drinking in the distant past, becoming edible exactly a week from now, and anything else.</p><p>Broadness is part of the strength of Toki Pona. It is easier to navigate than you think! Context is everything, and understanding a sentence is much easier when you're experiencing what it describes.</p><p>A helpful strategy for understanding a sentence with less context is to consider how reasonable it is. For example, <span class=tokipona>mi moku</span> is able to mean "we are food", but it is more likely that <span class=tokipona>mi</span> is just the speaker, and <span class=tokipona>moku</span> is "eat". You can use this thinking to reason about sentences in the future.</p><h4 id=hello-and-goodbye-2>Hello and Goodbye</h4><p>As in one of the examples, which is <em>not</em> a sentence, you can say <span class=tokipona>toki</span> on its own to mean "hello!"</p><p>Another one of the examples is a sentence, and is the most common way to say goodbye: <span class=tokipona>mi tawa</span>, "I am leaving!"</p><hr><div class=info><p>Don't forget, you can toggle the glyphs back to familiar letters with the <strong>Toggle SP</strong> button!</p></div><div class=lessonnav><p><a href=./open.html>Previous lesson</a> <a href=./li.html>Next lesson</a></p></div></div><div class=footer><h2 class=tokipona>o toki tawa mi</h2><p><a href=https://youtube.com/@gregdan3d><img src=/buttons/youtube.gif alt="@gregdan3d on YouTube"class=button> </a><a href=https://github.com/gregdan3><img src=/buttons/github.gif alt="@gregdan3 on GitHub"class=button> </a><a href=https://discord.com/users/497549183847497739><img src=/buttons/discord.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Discord"class=button> </a><a href=https://gregdan3.t.me/ ><img src=/buttons/telegram.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Telegram"class=button></a></p><p>Generated by my <a href=https://github.com/gregdan3/SWGIG>Static Website Generator I Guess</a>.
