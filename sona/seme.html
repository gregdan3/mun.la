A perfectly generic object.</table><h2 id=overview>Overview</h2><p>Questions are the cornerstone of speaking toki pona skillfully. Where a newbie speaker would be stuck wondering what a phrase or sentence means and not sure how to get past it, a skilled speaker knows what question to ask- in toki pona- to get the answer! In other words, if you master asking questions, you can make your way through any conversation!<p>In Toki Pona, there are three ways to ask questions, and many ways to answer them. You can use questions to cover gaps of all sorts- asking yes or no questions, clarifying something you misheard, asking what color and flavor yesterday was, and tons more.<p>Let's get into the first way of asking questions, with the word <span class=tokipona>ala</span>.<h4 id=asking-your-first-question-with-ala>Asking your first question with <span class=tokipona>ala</span></h4><p>We can turn any sentence into a question by doubling the first word of the predicate, then adding <span class=tokipona>ala</span> between them both. As a reminder, the predicate comes after <span class=tokipona>li</span>, or after <span class=tokipona>mi</span> or <span class=tokipona>sina</span> if they're alone in the subject! Here are some examples:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>sina pona ala pona?</span></summary><ul><li>Are you good?<li>Are y'all healing?<li>Is everyone okay?</ul></details><details><summary><span class=tokipona>kasi ale li weka ala weka?</span></summary><p>Are all the plants gone?<p>Did all the grass go away?<p>Will the forest disappear?</details><p>These questions are the closest to yes or no questions in English. But you might have noticed, Toki Pona has no words for answering questions- no "yes" and no "no"!<p>Instead, you answer questions by repeating the doubled word for "yes," or <span class=tokipona>ala</span> for "no." You may also say the word and <span class=tokipona>ala</span> together for no.<blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>ona li moku ala moku e ale?</span><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>moku</span></blockquote></blockquote><details><summary>Translation of the above!</summary><blockquote><p>Did they eat everything?<blockquote><p>Yep!</blockquote></blockquote></details><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>sina ken ala ken tawa?</span><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>ala.</span><p><span class=tokipona>ken ala.</span></blockquote></blockquote><details><summary>Translation of the above!</summary><blockquote><p>Are you able to move?<blockquote><p>No.<p>Can't.</blockquote></blockquote></details><div class=info><p>Some speakers will repeat sentences, partly or fully, when answering questions. If you repeat part of a question, start repeating it from a particle:<blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>ona li pini ala pini e musi?</span><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>ona li pini a</span></blockquote></blockquote><details><summary>Translation of the above!</summary><blockquote><p>Did they end the game?<blockquote><p>Yes, they ended (the game).</blockquote></blockquote></details></div><h4 id=asking-questions-with-anu-seme>Asking questions with <span class=tokipona>anu seme</span></h4><p>Another way to ask questions is to add the phrase <span class=tokipona>anu seme</span> to the end of it. This forms the same kind of question as <span class=tokipona>ala</span> did before, but there are some tricks to it!<blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>pipi li wile moku e pipi anu seme?</span><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>wile</span></blockquote></blockquote><p>As in this example, you answer "yes" like before, repeating the first word of the predicate as though it were doubled.<p>You also answer "no" like before:<blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>jan li kepeken ilo ni anu seme?</span><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>ala</span><p><span class=tokipona>kepeken ala</span></blockquote></blockquote><details><summary>Translation of the above!</summary><blockquote><p>Is the person using this tool, or what?<blockquote><p>No.<p>Not using.</blockquote></blockquote></details><p>Questions formed with <span class=tokipona>anu seme</span> are often about something the speaker wants to confirm.<p>In English, you might hear the question "You took out the trash, right?". The speaker expects you to have taken out the trash- the "right" part on the end shows that. So you'll respond "Yes, I did" or just "yes!". Hopefully!<p>You can ask the same type of question in Toki Pona using the phrase <span class=tokipona>anu seme</span>. Here's the example from above, with both possible answers:<blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>sina weka e jaki, anu seme?</span><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>weka</span><p><span class=tokipona>weka ala...</span></blockquote></blockquote><details><summary>Translation of the above!</summary><blockquote><p>You took out the trash, right?<blockquote><p>Yes!<p>No...</blockquote></blockquote></details><p><span class=tokipona>anu seme</span> questions - but it doesn't have the possible answers built into the grammar, unlike the questions we looked at before. The speaker believes something, and they just want you to confirm it!<p>So, now that we get that, let's look at a few more fun cases with <span class=tokipona>anu seme</span><h4 id=asking-about-no-with-anu-seme>Asking about "no" with <span class=tokipona>anu seme</span></h4><p>Since <span class=tokipona>anu seme</span> can be added to any sentence, you can use it to confirm negatives too! This leans heavily into this idea of assumption<blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>kulupu li tawa ala tomo anu seme?</span><blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><div class=warning><p>Asking questions about negatives can be just as confusing in Toki Pona as in English! When in doubt, saying more words to answer a question clearly never hurts!</div><details><summary></summary></details><details><summary>Translation of the above!</summary></details><ul><li>Asking about negatives<li>Asking rhetorical questions</ul><h4 id=anu-seme-can-be-anywhere-in-the-sentence><span class=tokipona>anu seme</span> can be anywhere in the sentence?!</h4><div class=info><p>I've only discussed <span class=tokipona>anu seme</span> at the end of sentences here, but you can add it to any part of speech! It's more common at the end of the sentence, so using using it elsewhere can occasionally confuse your listener, but it's always valid.<p>You'll see more of how to do this in the next lesson when we look closer at <span class=tokipona>anu</span></div><h4 id=asking-questions-with-seme>Asking questions with <span class=tokipona>seme</span></h4><p>Another way to turn a sentence into a question is to replace any content word with <span class=tokipona>seme</span>. This leaves a blank that your listener fills in, and you can put it anywhere!<h4 id=asking-multiple-questions-at-the-same-time>Asking multiple questions at the same time</h4><p>Sometimes, you have a lot of questions! Fortunately, Toki Pona speakers have lots of answers.<p>Questions formed with <span class=tokipona>ala</span> aren't mixed with questions formed using <span class=tokipona>anu seme</span>, because that would be redundant. This does the same thing to the sentence!<p>But you can put <span class=tokipona>seme</span> in every part of a sentence, and it'll always form a valid question- even used more than once! The<blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>seme la mi pana e mani seme tawa sina?</span><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>o pana e mani kepeken lipu mani. o pana e mani luka luka tu.</span></blockquote></blockquote><details><summary>Translation of the above!</summary><blockquote><p>1<blockquote><p>2</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p>How do I send you money, and how much do I send?<blockquote><p>Send money with your credit card. Send twelve dollars.</blockquote></blockquote><div class=warning><p>The translation here is pretty loose- the meaning is still the same, but the vibe is totally different. You've been warned!</div></details><div class=warning><p>Limit yourself to two <span class=tokipona>seme</span> in a single sentence. The more you add, the more confusing your sentence gets-</div><h4 id=lots-of-ways-to-answer-questions>Lots of ways to answer questions</h4><h4 id=frequently-asked-questions>Frequently Asked Questions</h4><p>This section is a quick summary of a few common and important questions you'll need as you study and practice! This is only a starting point though- many of these can be asked in a variety of other ways more than I list here. Be open minded and creative!<p><strong>Who?</strong> <strong>What?</strong><p>Both of these are generally formed in the same way- put <span class=tokipona>seme</span> in the subject!<blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>seme li pali e ni?</span></blockquote><p>If you know or need to be specific about the who or what being a person, then you would say <span class=tokipona>jan seme</span>.<p><strong>Where?</strong><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>lon seme? lon ma seme?</span></blockquote><p><strong>When?</strong><p><strong>Why?</strong><p>Why questions can be formed with <span class=tokipona>tan seme</span> or <span class=tokipona>seme la ...</span>!<p><strong>How?</strong><p><strong>Which?</strong><div class=info><p>Several of the question fragments stated here are often valid as full questions!
