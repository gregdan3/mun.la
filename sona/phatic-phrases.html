<hr>
<p>There is a <em>lot</em> of discourse about phatic phrases in Toki
Pona. A phatic phrase is a short and polite turn of phrase which usually
doesn’t convey deep meaning. Phatic phrases exist in Toki Pona. However,
myself and others discourage their use, for good reason. Do you want to
have the following conversation?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="tokipona">toki. sina seme?</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="tokipona">mi pona. sina seme?</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="tokipona">mi pona kin. (<em>pini</em>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Not really. This doesn’t convey anything about either speaker, and it
doesn’t give you anything to think about.</p>
<p>If a friend asks you how your day went, do you say “fine” and leave
it there? It isn’t <em>wrong</em> to do so.</p>
<p>If somebody teaches you a new skill, do you tell them only “thanks”
and end it there? Again, this is an acceptable way to express yourself,
but wouldn’t your teacher appreciate you expressing all of their impact
on you?</p>
<p>Toki Pona places an emphasis on simplicity and breaking down your
thoughts into their important units. However, this does <em>not</em>
encourage over-simplifying to the detriment of your conversations!</p>
<p>If you’re in a conversation, think deeply about what you do,
especially that your listener cares about. Answer earnestly about how
you feel, and what you appreciate in your friends, family, teachers, and
others. You should answer honestly to the questions “sina seme?” or
“seme li lon?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="tokipona">toki. sina seme?</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="tokipona">mi pona! tenpo pini la mi pali e lipu sona pi
toki ilo</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="tokipona">wawa a! lipu la seme li lon?</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="tokipona">lipu li pana e sona ni: ilo li ken…
<em>awen</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Toki Pona is more than a language. It is a philosophy too.</p>
<p>There is knowledge all around you. If you are excited to learn, you
should ask for the knowledge!</p>
<p>And there is love all around you too. If you care about your
relationships, show everyone that you care with your words.</p>
<h2 id="phrases-and-context">Phrases and context</h2>
<p>What follows is a sort of anti-phrasebook, suggesting
<em>continuations</em> or <em>replacements</em> for specific phrases
that would otherwise be phatic. Importantly, I provide context in
alternative situations for these, as they change depending on what is
currently happening!</p>
<p>Even then, this is far from everything that is possible. Keep your
mind open and keep exploring!</p>
<h3 id="sina-pona"><span class="tokipona">sina pona</span></h3>
<p><span class="tokipona">sina pona</span> is the common shorthand for
“thank you”, or “I appreciate you”, all in one. It literally means “you
are good.” On its own, it is an appreciated gesture, but how can you
answer more earnestly?</p>
<p>Each spoiler provides a casual interpretation, then a literal
one.</p>
<p>To someone who taught you a new skill:</p>
<details>
<summary>
<span class="tokipona">sina pona tan pana sona. sona la mi ken…</span>
</summary>
<p>I appreciate your teaching! It has taught me to…</p>
<p>You are good because of knowledge-giving. In the context of
knowledge, I am able to …</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<span class="tokipona">nasin sina li wawa a! mi sona la mi wawa.</span>
</summary>
<p>The process you described is very effective! My understanding of it
has helped me greatly.</p>
<p>Your method is powerful! If I understand, I am powerful.</p>
</details>
<p>To somebody who has given a gift:</p>
<details>
<summary>
<span class="tokipona">ijo sin ni li pona tawa mi, li pona e mi!</span>
</summary>
<p>This gift is fantastic for me, and made me feel better!</p>
<p>This new thing is good to me, and helped me!</p>
</details>
<h3 id="mi-tawa"><span class="tokipona">mi tawa</span></h3>
<p><span class="tokipona">mi tawa</span> is the common-use phrase for
“goodbye,” spoken by the person leaving. Its literal interpretation is
closer to “I am leaving”, or “I am moving” which contextually means
leaving. What if the kind of leaving you’re doing isn’t just about
moving, such as quitting a video game? What if the importance isn’t on
how you leave, but where you’re going?</p>
<p>You could express where you’re going:</p>
<details>
<summary>
<span class="tokipona">mi tawa ma sin</span>
</summary>
<p>I am leaving for somewhere new!</p>
<p>I go to a new place.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<span class="tokipona">mi tawa pali</span>
</summary>
I am going to work.
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<span class="tokipona">mi tawa tomo mi</span>
</summary>
I’m going to my home.
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<span class="tokipona">mi tawa tomo pi wawa sijelo</span>
</summary>
<p>I am going to the gym!</p>
<p>I am going to a body-power building.</p>
</details>
<p>Or you what you’re leaving to do:</p>
<details>
<summary>
<span class="tokipona">mi tawa la mi moku</span>
</summary>
<p>I’m leaving for dinner!</p>
<p>When I leave, I eat.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<span class="tokipona">mi o pali</span>
</summary>
<p>I have to do my job.</p>
<p>I should work.</p>
</details>
<p>Or talk about when you plan to come back:</p>
<details>
<summary>
<span class="tokipona">mi weka lili, mi kama sin</span>
</summary>
<p>I’m leaving for a short time, and I will come back!</p>
<p>I go away a little bit, and arrive again</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<span class="tokipona">mi tawa. tenpo kulupu kama la mi kama</span>
</summary>
<p>I’m leaving. I’m coming to the next meetup!</p>
<p>I’m going. At an arriving group time, I’ll arrive.</p>
</details>
<h3 id="tawa-pona-and-well-wishes"><span class="tokipona">tawa
pona</span> and well-wishes</h3>
<p><span class="tokipona">tawa pona</span> is the common-use phrase for
“goodbye”, spoken to the person who’s leaving generally. However, it is
a well-wishing statement. Many variations exist, including those spoken
by the one leaving.</p>
<p>Toki Pona: The Language of Good notes a few well-wishing phrases.
They are similar to commands led by <span class="tokipona">o</span>, but
do not have the intent of instruction.</p>
<p>To somebody who is working:</p>
<details>
<summary>
<span class="tokipona">pali pona!</span>
</summary>
<p>Have a good time at work!</p>
</details>
<p>When you are leaving, and the others are staying:</p>
<details>
<summary>
<span class="tokipona">awen pona!</span>
</summary>
<p>While you’re staying, have a good time!</p>
</details>
<p>When others are playing a game when you leave:</p>
<details>
<summary>
<span class="tokipona">musi pona!</span>
</summary>
<p>Have fun!</p>
</details>
<p>To somebody learning Toki Pona (or anything else):</p>
<details>
<summary>
<span class="tokipona">kama sona pona!</span>
</summary>
<p>Learn well!</p>
</details>
<h3 id="an-expression-in-context">An expression in context</h3>
<p>Imagine the following scenario:</p>
<p>You’re watching your friend race around a track, going for first
place. You friend has been lagging just barely behind first or second
throughout the race, but toward the end of the race, they get a second
wind and manage to pick up their pace just enough to take the win! After
the race, you rush up to them and say <span class="tokipona">sina tawa
pona a!</span> In context, this phrase is just as much “You moved well!”
as “You ran quickly!”</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Phatic phrases are not all bad. But when speaking Toki Pona, have an
open mind and an interest in deep conversations with those you’re
speaking to, and you’ll discover how incredibly cool those others are!
For that matter, have this open mind when you speak to anyone, in any
langauge. Phatic phrases are okay- but long, truly fascinated
conversations are the best kind.</p>
