Many advanced speakers will say that you eventually do not need specific units of time, or most math, and I’ve found this to be true as well. But I also find it unhelpful; units of time and mathematical concepts are important tools in language, and at that, the process of teaching how to reference these in Toki Pona is just as helpful as recognizing the unimportance of specific numbers in Toki Pona.</p> <p>This lesson is intended to cover that knowledge gap. How <em>do</em> you reference specific amounts of time in Toki Pona?</p> <p>Each minor section references a tool that can be used to reference specific amounts of time.</p> <h2 id=small-times>Small Times</h2> <h4 id=analogue-clocks>Analogue Clocks</h4> <p>introduction: how fast each moves compared to time</p> <p>small stick, hours</p> <p>big stick, minutes</p> <p>thin stick, seconds (if present)</p> <p>numbering each for ease of reference</p> <h4 id=digital-clocks>Digital Clocks</h4> <p>introduction: how often each changes compared to time</p> <h4 id=other-phenomena>Other Phenomena</h4> <p>TODO</p> <h2 id=big-times>Big Times</h2> <h4 id=sunrises-sunsets>Sunrises, Sunsets</h4> <h4 id=calendars>Calendars</h4> <h4 id=phases-of-the-moon>Phases of the Moon</h4> <h4 id=seasons>Seasons</h4> <h4 id=lifetimes>Lifetimes</h4> <hr> <p>Take these for example: There isn’t a word for discrete units of time like hour/min/second in toki pona. BUT the objects that count these times are frequently available, digital and analogue clocks. If you have an analogue clock, you can reference a time by describing what happens to the clock in the timeframe you want: “palisa lili pi ilo tenpo li tawa sike tu la, o kama” -&gt; “When the small stick of the time tool travels in a circle twice, arrive.” The same can be said of a digital clock: “nanpa wan pi ilo tenpo li ante tu la, o kama” -&gt; “When the first number of the time tool changes twice, arrive.”</p> <p>There’s also a fun example of this with a Gregorian calendar. tenpo esun and tenpo pali are relatively common ways to refer to a week, but both have different faults that make them not very good at this job. If you have a calendar present, you can note: “tenpo esun en tenpo pali li tenpo suno tu tu tu wan. taso lon lipu tenpo la tenpo ni li palisa lukin. ni la ona li tenpo palisa.” -&gt; “Shopping-time and working-time are seven sun times. But on a time document, this time is stick-looking. Because of this, it is a stick time.” Taken literally: on most calendars, a week is arranged from left to right. Taken as a unit, it’s a stick. stick time!</p> <p>I am not familiar with the lunar calendar. But this should be a good reference point for getting other time systems into toki pona: describing the properties of a system that DOES track time how you want, with the specificity you want.</p> </article> <footer> <p>Licensed under <a href=/LICENSE.txt>GPLv3</a>.</p> <p> Code on <a href=https://github.com/janKekanSan/jankekansan.github.io>my GitHub</a>. </p> </footer> <script src=/sptoggle.js></script> <script data-goatcounter=https://jankekansan.goatcounter.com/count async src=//gc.zgo.at/count.js></script> </body> </html>
