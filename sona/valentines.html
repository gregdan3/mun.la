Compliments take many forms.</p><p>They can focus on looks, personality traits, things you've done, skills you have, things you care about, and tons more.</p><p>But the core is pointing one of these things out, and saying what you see that's so good about it!</p><p>And this is something Toki Pona excels at- the honesty and directness of a good compliment is exactly what Toki Pona wants from <em>all</em> communication.</p><p>So let's go through lots of examples of compliments, given in Toki Pona!</p><p>This lesson is primarily example based, but I have a purely toki pona section near the end!</p><hr><p>Let's say a friend recently got a sweet haircut. It suits them so well. It's sharp. It's perfect from morning to night.</p><p>How many ways can we tell them we thing their hair is amazing? First, we can just say it:</p><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona lang=tok>linja lawa sina li pona mute a</span></p></blockquote><p>[Work this example]</p><p>Which translates to, "Your hair is amazing" or "Your hair is very good."</p><p>This pattern is gonna show up a lot, because most compliments boil down to describing something in a positive way.</p><p>But what if we wanted to get more specific? Let's make this way more</p><hr><div class=tp lang=tok><blockquote><p>sina weka tan lape lon tenpo poka, taso linja sina li awen pona tawa lukin</p></blockquote></div><p>Here, we're giving essentially the same compliment to your friend with their amazing hair. But this time, we're adding context to the compliment.</p><p>Translation: You woke up just a bit ago, but your hair still looks great!</p><p>The added context gives a little boost to the compliment. Your hair isn't just good- I would've expected some bedhead, but no, your hair is still great!</p><p>In other words, the compliment isn't just said for its own sake- there is a specific reason for why you're so impressed, and its adds to the compliment!</p><p>Let's look at another one:</p><hr><p>What if you wanted a more intimate compliment, like when you're already close to somebody?</p><p>You need to have established trust to make this work, but we can still explore what that might look like in Toki Pona:</p><p>If you're close enough to somebody that you're playing with their hair, a compliment to the feeling of their hair could be very welcome. Let's have a look:</p><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona lang=tok>linja sina li suwi a tawa pilin. mi wile lape lon ona</span></p></blockquote><p>The translation is something like, "Your hair is soft to the touch. I want to sleep on it"</p><p>Here, the focus shifts to how you relate to what you're complimenting-</p><p>This is from a really old discussion, but thanks to kulupu Kemeten and soweli Sopi for the inspiration on this one!</p><hr><p>You'll notice that these compliments got more complex as we went on! Adding a bit more detail to the way you're feeling, the experience you've had, to the vibe you'd like to express- these things can help your compliment feel more earnest. It isn't phatic- that is, it's <em>not</em> something you're saying just to say, or because you feel obligated to. There's a reason you're giving this compliment!</p><p>Alright, that's enough hair compliments! Let's try another subject:</p><hr><p>Let's imagine your friend is in an archery contest, and you came to watch but weren't totally sure what to expect. Your friend gets a super impressive score, places first, and after the fact you come talk to them about it:</p><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona lang=tok>mi lukin e sina lon utala pi ilo alasa! sina sona wawa e &gt; nasin pana.</span></p></blockquote><p>translation: I was watching you in the archery contest. You're very skilled at shooting.</p><p>I've picked a really specific example here, but this works for essentially any skill: They probably know they're skilled- but it feels good to be seen, and to be recognized for the skills you have.</p><hr><p>Alternatively, let's imagine your friend is especially skilled at crochet. They're showing off some of their work, and you're so excited by what you see, you say:</p><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona lang=tok>sina sona pali e soweli len suwi! a ona li suwi wawa, mi wile e ona!</span></p></blockquote><p>Here, the translation is about your excitement: "You're skilled in making cute yarn animals! It's so cute, I want one!"</p><p>This is another expression of compliments: the way you present yourself says something about the compliment and your feelings.</p><p>Your wording can express that, and so can your face and tone. If you're excited for your friend as you compliment them, the compliment works that much better.</p><hr><p>What if you're visiting a friend's home, and you're interested in everything on their shelves, or the pretty arrangement of their place?</p><p>Sometimes, a compliment can redirect just a bit, asking for somebody to tell a story:</p><blockquote><p>[tomo sina li pona a tawa mi! ijo mute li lon. ni li seme? seme la sina jo e ona?]</p></blockquote><p>Here, we start with a short and to the point compliment of your friend's home, but then redirect to the things in their home- and ask, what's this?</p><p>Little tip: A lot of people love to talk about themselves, their stuff, their story. Giving them that opportunity can be just as fun for them telling the story as you hearing it!</p><hr><p>Alright, one more!</p><blockquote><p>[mi tu li toki mute la mi pilin pona mute. tenpo kama la, sina wile ala wile musi?]</p></blockquote><p>This one's not just a compliment. It's a prompt too:</p><p>"When the two of us talk, I feel great. Later, would you want to play a game?"</p><hr><p>The common thread here that every compliment works like this:</p><p>You take something you like about somebody and describe that something in a positive way.</p><p>Toki Pona does more than give you the tools for compliments- the sincerity and literal-ness of Toki Pona <em>excels</em> at expressing compliments.</p><p>But one thing I haven't focused on here is subtext. Often, when giving a compliment, the giver will have more feelings, more to say, beyond the literal interpretation of their words. In some contexts, a compliment is just a compliment. In others, it can be an admission of attraction, or of shared excitement in a hobby or interest. Or you know, a compliment can just be an honest compliment.</p><p>I'll be frank here. Subtext is not something I'm good at. But I find it hard to believe that <em>no</em> toki pona has subtext. Fortunately, Toki Pona gives us one more tool: its earnesty makes it a bit easier to just ask, how are you feeling?</p><p>Or maybe ask...</p><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona lang=tok>toki a, suwi o. sina wile ala wile e ko</span></p></blockquote></div><div class=footer><h2 class=tp lang=tok>o toki tawa mi</h2><p><a href=https://youtube.com/@gregdan3d><img src=/buttons/youtube_s.gif alt="@gregdan3d on YouTube"class=button> </a><a href=https://github.com/gregdan3><img src=/buttons/github_s.gif alt="@gregdan3 on GitHub"class=button> </a><a href=https://discord.com/users/497549183847497739><img src=/buttons/discord_s.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Discord"class=button> </a><a href=https://gregdan3.t.me/ ><img src=/buttons/telegram_s.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Telegram"class=button></a></p></div><script src=/sptoggle.js></script><script data-goatcounter=https://jankekansan.goatcounter.com/count async src=//gc.zgo.at/count.js></script></div></html>
