The subject can now act on other things, applying the predicate to something else, with the use of <span class=tokipona>e</span>!</p><blockquote><p>[<span class=tokipona>mi</span>/<span class=tokipona>sina</span>] [predicate] <span class=tokipona>e</span> [object]</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[subject] <span class=tokipona>li</span> [predicate] <span class=tokipona>e</span> [object]</p></blockquote><p>This new phrase introduces a thing the subject acts on in a way that the predicate specifies.</p><details class=details><summary class=summary>A note about "predicate"</summary><p>I am using "predicate" to refer to <em>just</em> the position of the action/description of a phrase, excluding the object.</p><p>In common grammatical terms, "predicate" refers to the entirety of the action/description and the object(s) it acts on. However, it can also refer to just the action/description clause, which is very convenient for these lessons!</p></details><h4 id=changing-things>Changing things</h4><p>Here are a few guided examples of how the subject acts on the object, applying the predicate to it:</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>mi pona e jan</span></summary><ul><li>I help somebody.</li><li>I improve people.</li><li>I heal people.</li><li>I tend to people.</li><li>I make people feel better.</li></ul></details><p>The <span class=tokipona>jan</span> becomes <span class=tokipona>pona</span> in some way, as in the translations given.</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>lape li wawa e sina</span></summary><ul><li>Sleep makes you stronger</li><li>Rest makes you confident</li><li>Napping makes you energetic</li><li>Relaxing energizes you</li><li>Vacation empowers you</li></ul></details><p>Here, <span class=tokipona>sina</span> becomes <span class=tokipona>wawa</span> in some way.</p><h4 id=not-changing-things>Not changing things</h4><p>Not everything changes the object! Here are some examples, using two new words:</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>jan li pilin e kiwen</span></summary><ul><li>The person feels a rock.</li><li>Somebody touched metal.</li><li>Everyone touched this stone.</li><li>People have been feeling this rock.</li></ul></details><p>Here, the <span class=tokipona>kiwen</span> is <em>felt</em> or <em>touched</em>, but it never is or becomes <span class=tokipona>pilin</span>. Instead, the subject is the only one that does any <span class=tokipona>pilin</span>.</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>mi wile e telo</span></summary><ul><li>I want water</li><li>I need water</li><li>I need (liquid) fuel</li><li>I am thirsty</li></ul></details><p>Again, the <span class=tokipona>telo</span> is <em>wanted</em> or <em>needed</em>, but it does not become <span class=tokipona>wile</span> or do the action <span class=tokipona>wile</span> or become describable by <span class=tokipona>wile</span>. The subject <em>wants</em>, <em>needs</em>, <span class=tokipona>wile</span> the <span class=tokipona>telo</span>.</p><p>As you study, you'll get an intuitive sense for this difference. Some words will be actions the subject takes on an object, but which do not change that object. <span class=tokipona>pana</span> works this way! Other words will change the object, applying a new property to the object.</p><details class=details><summary class=summary>A note on "not" changing things</summary><p>As you become more advanced in Toki Pona, you'll learn that the above is complicated! It <em>is</em> possible to describe an object as a wanted object, and to apply want to that object. For the time being, this simplification will work.</p><p>That said, the following is possible:</p><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>mi wile e telo</span></p></blockquote><p>"I want water."</p><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>telo wile li pona e mi</span></p></blockquote><p>"The water I want will make me feel better."</p><p>This uses a modifier (next lesson!) to demonstrate the point, now referencing a "wanted liquid."</p></details><h4 id=multiple-e>Multiple e</h4><div class=info><p><a href=https://youtu.be/BGsodPu9UAw>Check out this video lesson too!</a> There are a few other topics here, but the very start has what you need!</p></div><p>Like <span class=tokipona>li</span>, <span class=tokipona>e</span> can be used more than once to apply a predicate to more than one object at a time! The predicate before applies to every object that follows. Like <span class=tokipona>li</span>, this is like "and" in English, but now for the object!</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>kasi li pilin e suno e telo</span></summary><p>The plant is feeling the sun and the water!</p></details><p>Here, the subject <span class=tokipona>kasi</span> (plant) is <span class=tokipona>pilin</span> (feeling) both <span class=tokipona>suno</span> and <span class=tokipona>telo</span>, (light and water).</p><p>Here's another example:</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>mi moku e suwi e lete</span></summary><p>I eat sweets and ice cubes!</p><p>I eat sugar and ice.</p></details><p>Here, the subject <span class=tokipona>mi</span> (I) is eating <span class=tokipona>suwi</span> (something sweet) and <span class=tokipona>lete</span>, something cold.</p><h4 id=multiple-li-and-multiple-e>Multiple li and multiple e</h4><p>When using multiple <span class=tokipona>li</span> <em>and</em> multiple <span class=tokipona>e</span>, objects connect to the predicate right before. We saw this with using two <span class=tokipona>e</span>, but it also applies if you use <span class=tokipona>li</span> twice then <span class=tokipona>e</span>- the first <span class=tokipona>li</span> has no object, only the second one does.</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>kasi li suwi li pana e ko</span></summary><p>The plant is sweet, and gives off dust!</p><p>The plant is cute, and is spitting sap!</p></details><p>Here, the <span class=tokipona>kasi</span> is <span class=tokipona>suwi</span>, and at the same time, it <span class=tokipona>pana</span> (gives) some <span class=tokipona>ko</span> (dust, slime)</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>kasi li pana e ko li suwi</span></summary><p>The plant gives off dust, and is sweet!</p></details><p>This sentence means the same thing, but has the connected predicate and object, <span class=tokipona>pana</span> and <span class=tokipona>ko</span> swapped with the single predicate <span class=tokipona>pana</span>. The meaning is still the same!</p><p>Objects <em>always</em> connect to the predicate before. For multiple <span class=tokipona>e</span> with multiple <span class=tokipona>li</span>, the rules are the same as with just multiple <span class=tokipona>e</span>!</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>jan li jaki e lipu li telo e lipu</span></summary><p>The person made a mess on the book and cleaned the book.</p></details><p>Here, <span class=tokipona>jan</span> (a person) does two actions, acting on to two objects with each: First, they <span class=tokipona>jaki</span> (make gross) a <span class=tokipona>lipu</span> (document, book), then they <span class=tokipona>telo</span> (water, clean) a <span class=tokipona>lipu</span>. Often, the same word referenced twice is referring to the same object- so <span class=tokipona>lipu</span> could be the same both times! But it can be a different object too. Watch for context!</p><div class=warning><p>The last part of this section is a bit more advanced- it requires you to be thoughtful and intentional about how you speak. If you wanna get right to practice, <a href=#exercises>check out the exercises</a>!</p></div><p>There is some room for experimentation! The sentence from before can be made shorter but understood the same with relaxed grammar:</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>jan li jaki li telo e lipu</span></summary><p><strong>If <span class=tokipona>jaki</span> and <span class=tokipona>telo</span> both apply to the <span class=tokipona>lipu</span></strong>:</p><p>Somebody made a mess on this book, and cleaned it.</p><p><strong>If they are separate statements in the same sentence</strong>:</p><p>Somebody is gross, and cleaned this book.</p></details><p>Normally, the first predicate <span class=tokipona>jaki</span> would not connect to the object <span class=tokipona>lipu</span>. But some speakers will apply two or more predicates to the same object, like this sentence- it's relaxed!</p><p>Here, <span class=tokipona>jan</span> (a person) does two actions, acting on to one object with each: First, they <span class=tokipona>jaki</span> (make gross) a <span class=tokipona>lipu</span> (document, book), then they <span class=tokipona>telo</span> (water, clean) a <span class=tokipona>lipu</span>. Often, the same word in the same position a second time means the same object- so the <span class=tokipona>lipu</span> could be the same both times! But it can be a different object too. Watch for context!</p><p>If you haven't checked under the spoiler already, check now. There are multiple meanings possible if you use this relaxed grammar!</p><div class=info><p>When somebody doesn't understand you, try restating yourself.
