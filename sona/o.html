I separated them to make them easier to remember.<h2 id=overview>Overview</h2><h4 id=instructions>Instructions</h4><p>We're going to look at another new sentence! We'll use the particle <span class=tokipona>o</span>, so we can give instructions or set out requirements.<p>The particle <span class=tokipona>o</span> is like <span class=tokipona>li</span>. It takes the same place in the sentence, but it changes the meaning: now, the sentence is an instruction!<p>You may give instructions without a subject, which are directed at the listener:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>o lukin e kulupu kasi</span></summary><p>Look at the forest.<p>Look at the garden.</details><p>This is the most common form of an instruction, <em>without</em> a subject.<div class=info><p>In Toki Pona, it is not rude to give an instruction. If you say <span class=tokipona>o ni</span> as in "Do this", it is as polite as "Can you please do this?" in English. There is no "please" in Toki Pona, and no need for it!</div><p>You may also give instructions to a specific subject:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>jan lili o musi nasa ala</span></summary><p><strong>If <span class=tokipona>jan lili</span> is listening</strong>: Child, stop being silly!<p><strong>If <span class=tokipona>jan lili</span> is not listening</strong>: The child has to stop being silly.</details><p>If the subject is not listening or not able to listen, you would interpret the statement as a requirement instead of a given instruction.<details><summary><span class=tokipona>lipu o pakala ala</span></summary><p>The paper should not be ripped.<p>The paper must not be torn.<p>The documents should not be shredded.</details><p>This also applies to inanimate things! What does it mean to give instructions or requirements to a building, collection, light, or colors?<p>You can also reword these as instructions:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>o pakala ala e lipu</span></summary><p>Do not tear the paper.<p>Do not shred the documents. indicate</details><p>Now the listener is responsible for the paper!<details><summary>A note about politeness</summary><p>It is possible to be rude in Toki Pona, as it is possible in any language. But in English, we soften requests with lots of extra words, such as please and can. In Toki Pona, there is an assumption that you are being earnest and respectful of your listener, so a request doesn't need to be softened with other words. This is often called a "polite default" assumption, but I call it an "earnest default."</details><h4 id=attention>Attention</h4><p>You may use <span class=tokipona>o</span> directly after a subject phrase to get that subject's attention:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>mama o</span></summary><p>Mom! [mom looks over]<p>Dad! [dad looks over]</details><div class=info><p>This is an interjection, which we'll learn more about in the next lesson!</div><p>This may appear before or after a sentence, but both mean the same:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>jan sona o! sina pona</span></summary><p>Teacher, you're excellent!</details><details><summary><span class=tokipona>sina pona! jan sona o</span></summary><p>You're excellent, teacher!</details><p>Here, <span class=tokipona>jan sona o</span> is getting the attention of <span class=tokipona>jan sona</span>, and the speaker says a complete sentence directed at them. The order of the sentence and interjection doesn't matter, so do what feels right in the moment.<p>You can use this interjection with an instruction, so you know that an instruction will be heard by its intended listener:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>jan ale o! o pana e lipu sina</span></summary><p>Everyone, please turn in your papers!</details><p>And you can put the two together, because an instruction with a subject can get the attention of that subject at the same time as instructing or requiring:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>jan ale o pana e lipu sina</span></summary><p>Everyone, please turn in your papers!<p>Everyone must turn in their papers.</details><h4 id=taso-sentences><span class=tokipona>taso</span> sentences</h4><p>Sometimes you'll see <span class=tokipona>taso</span> at the start of a sentence. This is like saying "but" or "however," and is usually used before a <em>later</em> sentence to connect two ideas.<details><summary><span class=tokipona>mi kute e pakala! taso mi pona</span></summary><p>I heard something break. But I'm alright!</details><p>The first sentence establishes context, and the second provides some clarifying or contrary information.<p>For comparison, here is the second sentence without <span class=tokipona>taso</span>:<blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>mi kute e pakala! mi pona</span></blockquote><p>Without <span class=tokipona>taso</span>, the sentences are not as clearly related.<h4 id=taso-modifier><span class=tokipona>taso</span> modifier</h4><p><span class=tokipona>taso</span> is a modifier the rest of the time, but usually as the <em>last</em> modifier of a phrase, affecting the entire phrase. Consider these examples:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>kute taso li pona e sona sina</span></summary><p>(Only listening) can improve your understanding.</details><details><summary><span class=tokipona>kute li pona taso e sona sina</span></summary><p>Listening will (only improve) your understanding.</details><details><summary><span class=tokipona>kute li pona e sona sina taso</span></summary><p>Listening will improve (your understanding only).</details><h4 id=taso-head><span class=tokipona>taso</span> head</h4><p>taso can also be the head of a phrase, used as a normal content word:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>taso li pona</span></summary><p>Being alone is good.<p>Exclusivity is good.</details><details><summary><span class=tokipona>ona li kama taso</span></summary><p>They became alone.</details><p>This is a rare use though; taso is most used together with other concepts!<h2 id=exercises>Exercises</h2><div class=info><p>In previous lessons, I gave many interpretations for each sentence. As these sentences get longer and more complex, I provide fewer or only one interpretation, but there are other interpretations; try thinking of a few!</div><h3 id=toki-pona-to-english>Toki Pona to English</h3><h4 id=o-for-commands><span class=tokipona>o</span> for commands</h4><p>You're on a camping trip in the hills of a huge mountain range, and have a ranger with you to help the trip and provide knowledge of nature! You get back to your camp one night before sunset, and find a bear digging through your food. Oh no, you've gotta stop it! But the ranger tells you in hushed but serious tone:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>o utala ala e soweli</span></summary><p>Don't attack the bear!</details><p>You're on a boat with some friends, enjoying the sun and the wind. One of your friends has been intently watching over the side, waiting for... Something? Eventually, they call out to everyone to come look, because they spotted something! They say:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>o lukin e kala suli</span></summary><p>Look at this huuuuge fish!</details><p>Your neighbor somehow caught a bird, put it in a box, and is planning to keep it. Oh no, the poor bird! You explain to them that birds want to fly and be free, and tell them:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>o poki ala e waso</span></summary><p>Don't put the birds in a box!</details><p>You've been frustratedly working on a piece of art for some time. It's a painting you wanted to gift to your teacher, but you don't think it's coming out right and want to destroy it. You show it to one of your friends for advice, and they say:<details><summary><span class=tokipona><strong>o moli ala e sitelen sina! ona li pona</strong></span></summary><p>Don't kill your painting. It's fantastic!<p>Don't destroy your painting. It's fantastic!<div class=info><p><strong>moli</strong> here is being used to mean the same as <strong>pakala</strong>, but for something which is important or meaningful. This is incorrect if taking <strong>moli</strong> at face value, but it is still a common use in the community!</div></details><h4 id=o-with-a-subject><span class=tokipona>o</span> with a subject</h4><p>Your dad is leaving you at home while he runs errands. He wants you to clean the house, because you made a mess of the place not long ago, bringing in a bunch of branches from outside. He says to you:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>palisa o jaki ala e tomo! o weka e palisa</span></summary><p>Sticks must not make the house gross. Remove the sticks!</details><p>You've been hanging out on the porch for too long, and you've started to notice lots of obnoxious bugs coming out as the sun sets. In your frustration, you yell out at the bugs:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>pipi o weka! o moli!</span></summary><p>Bugs, go away! Die!<p>Bugs have to go away! And die!</details><p>You're trying to play a board game with a group of friends, but only one of you knows the rules. The rest of you are sitting together, trying to make sense of the rules, when one of the group pipes up:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>jan pi sona musi o pana e sona</span></summary><p>The person who knows about the game should explain!</details><p>You're explaining the rules to the game: When the leader covers their eyes, everyone runs as fast as they can. When the leader opens their eyes, if anyone is seen moving they're out! You explain:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>ona ale o tawa ala</span></summary><p>They all must not move!</details><p>You're in a cooking competition! The dish on order: authentic pasta. When the order comes in, you think long and hard about it; there's a lot of competition. Your coach chimes in with similar thinking, saying:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>pan sina o pona wawa</span></summary><p>Your pasta has to come out <em>amazingly</em>!</details><h4 id=o-for-attention><span class=tokipona>o</span> for attention</h4><p>You spotted a cute squirrel, and you're trying to get its attention!<details><summary><span class=tokipona>soweli o</span></summary><p>Hey squirrel!</details><p>You brought your friend out to birdwatch with you.

Your friend is a morning person and loves feeling the sun as they're productive. You like the sun, but prefer to work in the dark when the moon is out. You tell them:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>suno li pona! taso pimeja li pona e ken sitelen mi</span></summary><p>The sun is good, but darkness helps my writing ability.<hr><ul><li>Sunlight is okay, but the shade improves my writing performance.<li>Lights are wonderful, but I prefer no lights for my writing.</ul></details><p>It's the middle of winter, and you've seen nothing but dreary gray skies for weeks. One day, the cloud cover finally breaks, opening up to reveal beautiful sunlight! You step outside to bask, but unfortunately, the air is still frigid around you. You remark to yourself:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>mi pilin e suno. taso mi lete</span></summary><p>I feel the sunlight, but I feel cold.</details><p>You're a genius inventor, working on an amazing new tool: a working pair of wings you can strap to your back!

The most recent one seems rather obvious to you, but you don't let them know that. The statement:<details><summary><span class=tokipona><strong>ala li pona taso</strong></span></summary><p>Nothing is exclusively good.<p>Nothingness is only good!<div class=info><p>This statement has two possible interpretations, even in the given context! It could be saying that <em>no object exists which is entirely good</em>, or <em>nothingness itself is exclusively good</em>. Maybe your friend is wiser than you thought?</div></details><p>Your friend is down-trodden, feeling rejected. They haven't been invited to any parties or events lately, and are worried that all their friends are abandoning them. As a way of lashing out, they insist their friends are the problem, but you console them with some helpful perspective:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>jan pona sina li ike ala. ona li pali taso. ona li wile e sina</span></summary><p>Your friends are not mean! They're only working. They want you.</details><p>You've been thinking long and hard about an upcoming event. You want it to be the most thrilling event to ever happen in your city- but you don't know to do it without the help of somebody you <em>really</em> don't want to ask for help. But it's worth it. You resolve to get their help, and say to yourself:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>ona taso li ken wawa e kulupu</span></summary><p>Only they are able to excite the party!<div class=info><p><span class=tokipona>wawa</span> here is being used to mean "intensify."

In English, saying "I only want the rock" means the <em>rock</em> is the exclusive thing in the sentence. When translated in the first example, <span class=tokipona>taso</span> only applies to the object. In the third example, <span class=tokipona>taso</span> applies to the predicate. Like the original English, this is understandable, but the former is more apt!<p>But with <span class=tokipona>taso</span> on the predicate, the action of the sentence would be the "only/exclusive" thing, to some listeners!</div></details><details><summary>They only have their id card.</summary><p><span class=tokipona>ona li jo e lipu ona taso</span><p><span class=tokipona>ona li jo e lipu jan ona taso</span><div class=info><p>Here, if <span class=tokipona>jo</span> were <span class=tokipona>taso</span>, it would mean they only action they were taking is having their ID card.

Giving somebody an instruction is not rude unless you are <em>very</em> intentional about being rude. You can tell somebody what to do, and it's perfectly okay for them to say "mi ken ala" -&gt; "I am unable to."<h4 id=grammar>Grammar</h4><p>You can use <span class=tokipona>o</span> in place of <span class=tokipona>li</span> in a sentence to turn that sentence into an instruction or command! This doesn't change the grammar much, but you can omit the subject before <span class=tokipona>o</span> in which case it is intended for the listener.<p>You can optionally include <span class=tokipona>taso</span> before a sentence, which connects it to previous statements in a similar way to "but" or "however" in English.<blockquote><p>(<span class=tokipona>taso</span>) [subject] (<span class=tokipona>li</span>) [predicate] (<span class=tokipona>e</span> [object])</blockquote><p>taso can be used at the end of a phrase to indicate that particular phrase is exclusive.<p>There's also a bit more freedom for what can go <em>around</em> a sentence. You can interject subjects, followed by o, to indicate who should be listening!<hr><p><a href=./preps.html>Previous lesson</a><p><a href=./interjections.html>Next lesson</a></article><footer><h2 class=tokipona>o toki tawa mi</h2><p><a href=https://youtube.com/@gregdan3d><img src=/buttons/youtube.gif alt="@gregdan3d on YouTube"> </a><a href=https://github.com/gregdan3><img src=/buttons/github.gif alt="@gregdan3 on GitHub"> </a><a href=https://discord.com/users/497549183847497739><img src=/buttons/discord.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Discord"> </a><a href=https://gregdan3.t.me/ ><img src=/buttons/telegram.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Telegram"></a><p>Generated by my <a href=https://github.com/gregdan3/SWGIG>Static Website Generator I Guess</a>.
