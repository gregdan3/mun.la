Can we replicate that in Toki Pona? Absolutely.</p><p>First, the original text:</p><blockquote><p>Welcome to Conlang Critic, the show that gets facts wrong about <em>your</em> favorite conlang!</p></blockquote><p>And this is followed by jan Misali's self introduction.</p><h2 id=specific-translations>Specific translations</h2><h3 id=welcome>Welcome</h3><p>Welcomes are simple! They are usually expressed as an instruction using <span class=tokipona>o</span>, and ended with <span class=tokipona>pona</span> to express the well-wishing nature of the instruction. Otherwise, a welcome is a kind of arrival, so we can use <span class=tokipona>kama</span>: <span class=tokipona>o kama pona</span></p><p>You can also use the preposition <span class=tokipona>tawa</span> to express where you're welcoming somebody to, giving us <span class=tokipona>o kama pona tawa ...</span></p><h3 id=conlang-critic>Conlang Critic</h3><p>Conlang Critic could be a proper name by capitalizing it, or you could translate it. In either case, jan Misali says it's a show, and a show is entertainment, which is <span class=tokipona>musi</span>. If you use a proper noun, your job is done here: <span class=tokipona>musi</span> (Conlang Critic), or whatever adaptation you prefer. You can do a little better when you zoom in on "Conlang Critic" though!</p><h3 id=conlangs>Conlangs</h3><p>"Conlang," short for constructed language, could be described as both <span class=tokipona>pali</span> (creation) and <span class=tokipona>toki</span> (language). This is an important decision when deciding translations: which one is more important, and so becomes the head noun? Here, we'll say that a constructed language is a "language" before it is "constructed". But since both work, we use both words, and call it a <span class=tokipona>toki pali</span></p><h3 id=critics>Critics</h3><p>As for "critic," we don't need to translate it as a single phrase. Critics do one thing: talk about a subject. Let's make that a separate sentence! Our speaker will refer to themselves with <span class=tokipona>mi</span>, and will talk with <span class=tokipona>toki</span>. Then, it is common to say you talk "about" something using the preposition <span class=tokipona>lon</span>: <span class=tokipona>jan li toki <strong>lon</strong> ijo</span>. There are more ways you could translate talking "about" something, but we'll stick with <span class=tokipona>lon</span>!</p><h3 id=favorites>Favorites</h3><p>When describing their preferences, most speakers refer to things being <span class=tokipona>pona tawa mi</span>, "good to me". Then, a favorite is often expressed as being "the most good", or "first place" in goodness! With this, we can say that this is <span class=tokipona>nanpa wan</span>, which can apply to anything: <span class=tokipona>ni li pona nanpa wan tawa mi</span>. So now we know our critic will talk about <span class=tokipona>toki pali sina nanpa wan</span>, your favorite conlang!</p><h3 id=facts-wrongness>Facts, Wrongness</h3><p>Facts and wrongness often have to do with <span class=tokipona>lon</span> and <span class=tokipona>lon ala</span> respectively. <span class=tokipona>lon</span> deals with truth, so we could have our critic will speak in an untruthful way: <span class=tokipona>toki pi lon ala</span>. Let's try it!</p><h2 id=putting-it-together>Putting it together</h2><h3 id=attempt-1>Attempt #1</h3><p>Here's the two halves of the opener we've made so far. Translations are under the spoilers.</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>o kama pona tawa musi mi! mi toki lon toki pali.</span></summary><p>Welcome to my entertainment! I talk about created languages.</p></details><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>toki sina nanpa wan la musi ni li toki pi lon ala!</span></summary><p>In the context of your favorite language, this entertainment tells lies!</p></details><p>Looking good so far! You'll notice that in the second sentence, we refer to only <span class=tokipona>toki sina nanpa wan</span> instead of <span class=tokipona>toki pali sina nanpa wan</span>. This is because we've already introduced the fact that the critic is going to talk about <span class=tokipona>toki pali</span>. From there, it's clear that <span class=tokipona>toki</span> alone refers back to the same <span class=tokipona>toki pali</span>.</p><p>Except there's still one problem: that's not quite the original meaning! <span class=tokipona>toki pi lon ala</span> definitely captures the idea of <em>lying</em>, but the statement actually says they're getting facts <em>wrong</em>, jokingly, about your favorite conlang. We've translated the idea of being wrong correctly; in the process, we've translated it too literally. The intended meaning is about making mistakes, which is more like <span class=tokipona>pakala</span>! Let's try again:</p><h3 id=attempt-2>Attempt #2</h3><p>The first half was already great, so here's the edited second half:</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>toki sina nanpa wan la, musi ni li toki pakala!</span></summary><p>In the context of your favorite language, this entertainment speaks mistakenly!</p></details><p>That's exactly what we want! It's short, punchy, and conveys the original humor as faithfully as Toki Pona can do.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>The process of translation, especially into Toki Pona, can never be one-to-one. You make compromises, subtle changes, and artistic and informational decisions throughout an entire dialog. The skills that will help you most are recognizing the objects and actions of a sentence, and breaking those down individually without the rest of the sentence. This will get faster over time too, until you're no longer thinking about it!</p><center><p>Also, I recorded the final result.
