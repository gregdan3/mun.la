We already know some of them as normal content words!<h4 id=every-pre-predicate>Every Pre-predicate</h4><hr><h5 id=wile>wile</h5><details><summary><span class=tokipona>mi wile pali</span></summary><p>I want to create.<p>I want to work.</details><p>The <span class=tokipona>wile</span> pre-pred means the predicate is wanted or needed.<p>You could say:<blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>mi wile e pali</span></blockquote><p>And that <em>could</em> mean the same thing. But it's more clear to say <span class=tokipona>mi wile pali</span>.<div class=info><p>When something is in the object, it is often considered <em>not</em> an action. If you want to talk about a wanted <em>action</em>, ensuring that word is in the <strong>predicate</strong> is the most clear!</div><hr><h5 id=ken>ken</h5><details><summary><span class=tokipona>mi ken wawa</span></summary><p>I can be strong.</details><p>The <span class=tokipona>ken</span> pre-pred means the predicate is an ability or permission. Consider this version:<blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>ken mi li wawa</span></blockquote><p>Again, this has a similar meaning to the original statement that used a pre-predicate.<div class=info><p>You can often restate a sentence <em>without</em> a pre-predicate. Using pre-predicates saves time and makes you more clear!</div><hr><h5 id=kama>kama</h5><details><summary><span class=tokipona>sina kama sona</span></summary><p>You are learning!</details><p>The <span class=tokipona>kama</span> pre-pred refers to things changing, which may be beginnings or endings, or something becoming different over time! It's similar to words in English that end with "-ing," such as learning or growing.<details><summary><span class=tokipona>kasi li kama suli</span></summary><p>The plant is growing!<p>The plant is becoming huge!</details><details><summary><span class=tokipona>jan lili li kama lape</span></summary><p>The child goes to sleep.</details><hr><h5 id=awen>awen</h5><details><summary><span class=tokipona>mi awen kute</span></summary><p>I am still listening.</details><p>The <span class=tokipona>awen</span> pre-pred means the predicate describes something staying the same- <em>not</em> changing, as opposed to the <span class=tokipona>kama</span> pre-pred which does refer to change.<p>You can still restate this without the pre-predicate:<blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>kute mi li awen</span></blockquote><p>But still, the predicate version is most clear to the "listening" meaning.<hr><h5 id=sona>sona</h5><details><summary><span class=tokipona>ona li sona pakala e ni</span></summary><div class=warning><p>You can't always tell apart a normal predicate from a pre-predicate.

Consider this:<blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>mi sona e pali</span></blockquote><p>The same action-versus-thing distinction happens as with the <span class=tokipona>ken</span> pre-pred. If something is an action, or knowledge of an action, that will be better understood in the predicate.<hr><h5 id=alasa-lukin>alasa / lukin</h5><details><summary><span class=tokipona>mi alasa pona e sina / mi lukin pona e sina</span></summary><p>I'm trying to help you!</details><p>Lastly, there's <span class=tokipona>alasa</span> and <span class=tokipona>lukin</span>, which have the same meaning as pre-preds: to try. I recommend <span class=tokipona>alasa</span> most: it is more commonly used. But both will be understood, so use whichever you feel!<div class=info><p><span class=tokipona>alasa</span> and <span class=tokipona>lukin</span> mean the same as pre-preds because Toki Pona has changed over time, even as a constructed language!</div><hr><p>Here are some extra notes on pre-predicates before you continue:<div class=info><p>You can use a pre-predicate with itself in the predicate, such as saying <span class=tokipona>mi wile wile</span>! This is not common, because the pre-predicate usually does what you need.</div><div class=warning><p>We can't ignore pre-predicates like we ignored modifiers before. They <em>do</em> change the predicate, where modifiers just make it more specific!</div><h4 id=multiple-pre-predicates>Multiple pre-predicates</h4><p>Like modifiers, you can use multiple pre-predicates at once!<details><summary><span class=tokipona>mi awen ken mama e kasi</span></summary><p>I am still able to raise plants.<p>I am still able to grow plants.</details><ul><li><span class=tokipona>awen</span> means something is ongoing<li><span class=tokipona>ken</span> means something is an ability<li><span class=tokipona>mama</span> is the predicate, making this a parenting action.</ul><p>The order of pre-predicates matters. Consider this:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>mi ken awen mama e kasi</span></summary><p>I am able to continue raising plants.</details><p>Multiple pre-predicates apply from left to right. The thing that is <span class=tokipona>ken</span> is the <span class=tokipona>awen mama</span>, and the thing that is <span class=tokipona>awen</span> is <span class=tokipona>mama</span>.<p>In the original, the thing that is <span class=tokipona>awen</span> is <span class=tokipona>ken mama</span>, and the thing that is <span class=tokipona>ken</span> is <span class=tokipona>mama</span>.<h4 id=ala>ala</h4><p><span class=tokipona>ala</span> has a simple function: negate the previous word or phrase.<details><summary><span class=tokipona>mi pona ala</span></summary><p>I'm not well.<p>I'm not good.</details><p>Here, <span class=tokipona>pona</span> is negated by <span class=tokipona>ala</span>- it's like saying "not".<div class=warning><p>Toki Pona words don't have opposites. There are some uses of <span class=tokipona>pona</span> opposite to uses of <span class=tokipona>ike</span>, but <span class=tokipona>pona ala</span> is <em>not</em> <span class=tokipona>ike</span>.</div><p>Compare the phrases "this is good" and "this is not bad" in English. They can be close in meaning, but the negation does not make them the same.<details><summary><span class=tokipona>jan ala li ante e lipu</span></summary><p>Nobody changed the book.<p>A non-person changed the book.<div class=warning><p>Two interpretations are possible here!

This is especially true when an <strong>object</strong> is present with <span class=tokipona>e</span>.<p>If something is in the <strong>object</strong>, it will often be assumed to be a <strong>thing</strong>, especially something physical.<p>Neither of these are true <em>all</em> the time, but they are true enough that you can rely on it! If you want to reference an action, putting that in the predicate can be helpful, and the same goes for putting physical things in the object.<p>Most of what pre-preds are used for can be said <em>without</em> pre-preds. But using them makes you much more understandable.<h4 id=ambiguity>Ambiguity</h4><p>In this lesson, we saw that some phrases are <strong>ambiguous</strong>. There are multiple possible interpretations, statements that need more detail, and more. This is a common feature of Toki Pona. You do not need to specifically learn to avoid it- that will come naturally as you figure out what works and what doesn't!<p>That said, if any ambiguity or even simple misunderstanding comes up when speaking, restating yourself is helpful!<hr><p><a href=./mod-pi.html>Previous lesson</a><p><a href=./preps.html>Next lesson</a></article><footer><h2 class=tokipona>o toki tawa mi</h2><p><a href=https://youtube.com/@gregdan3d><img src=/buttons/youtube.gif alt="@gregdan3d on YouTube"> </a><a href=https://github.com/gregdan3><img src=/buttons/github.gif alt="@gregdan3 on GitHub"> </a><a href=https://discord.com/users/497549183847497739><img src=/buttons/discord.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Discord"> </a><a href=https://gregdan3.t.me/ ><img src=/buttons/telegram.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Telegram"></a><p>Generated by my <a href=https://github.com/gregdan3/SWGIG>Static Website Generator I Guess</a>.
