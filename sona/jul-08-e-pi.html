This lesson assumes you caught my lesson last month about how <strong>li</strong> and <strong>modifiers</strong> work!</p> <p>Also, remember that we’re doing the vocab as we go, instead of all up front. We’re focusing on the grammar and the feel of Toki Pona- and you can memorize the words on your own!</p> <p>Let’s get right into it with an example, starting with, what is <strong>e</strong>, and what is <strong>pi</strong>?</p> <hr> <p>We Know that we can talk about what the subject is doing or being with the word <strong>li</strong>.</p> <p>The word <strong>e</strong> gives us a new tool: we can talk about what the subject <em>does to</em> somebody or something else! Here’s a basic example of what that looks like:</p> <blockquote> <p><span class=tokipona>suno li seli e mi</span></p> </blockquote> <p>This means “the sun heats me.” Interpreted very literally, you might say “the sun applies warmth to me.”</p> <p>With <strong>e</strong>, the subject <em>changes</em> the object. So the sun is changing “mi”, and that change is “seli”. So I could then say:</p> <blockquote> <p><span class=tokipona>mi seli</span></p> </blockquote> <hr> <p>But not every word is so clear as seli when used with <strong>e</strong>. Take for example, <strong>pona</strong>:</p> <blockquote> <p><span class=tokipona>mi pona e tomo</span></p> </blockquote> <p>We know the definition of pona to be good, positive, simple, or pleasant.</p> <p>Here, we might interpret it as meaning heal, help, repair, or improve.</p> <p>Since pona is in a new part of the sentence, we <em>interpret</em> a little differently to match.</p> <p>But the meaning of pona is still the same. All that’s changed is the usage, and thus how we might translate it into English.</p> <p>Case in point, you could also translate this as “I apply good to the building.”</p> <p>Now that we understand the basics of <strong>e</strong>, let’s look at some more examples.</p> <hr> <p>Just like with the subject before <strong>li</strong> and the verb after, we can put just about any word we want after <strong>e</strong>:</p> <blockquote> <p><span class=tokipona>kulupu li wile e pali mi</span></p> </blockquote> <p>The words after <strong>e</strong> can be people, places, things, actions, ideas, literally anything.</p> <p>But this sentence is a little odd based on what we’ve learned- we’re not saying that the “pali mi”, “my work” becomes able to want, right? It “becomes wanted,” maybe?</p> <p>That’s about interpretation! There are a few words that work with e, but don’t necessarily change the object when they do it.</p> <p>To be clear, you could still say:</p> <blockquote> <p><span class=tokipona>pali mi li wile</span></p> </blockquote> <p>And that would be correct- but some speakers discourage or avoid this, because it can be a little confusing. I would say experiment and figure out what works for you!</p> <p>Here’s another example though:</p> <blockquote> <p><span class=tokipona>sina lukin e kili tu</span></p> </blockquote> <p>Again, this is a special case. This probably doesn’t mean “the two fruits become able to see.” It could mean “the two fruits become seen.”</p> <p>But mostly, this is another case where the object is unchanged by an action.</p> <p>You are looking, viewing, observing, but the kili tu are the same.</p> <p>So what we’ve learned is that <strong>e</strong> sometimes just describes an action that involves, but doesn’t change, the object. Sure!</p> <p>As you practice, you’ll get a feel for this difference, but</p> <blockquote> <p><span class=tokipona>lukin wile sona pilin</span></p> </blockquote> <p>do this often.</p> <hr> <p>Next, there’s the word <strong>pi</strong>.</p> <blockquote> <p><span class=tokipona>mun li pana e sona pi toki pona</span></p> </blockquote> <p><strong>pi</strong> lets you make fancier modifiers, to any part of speech.</p> <p>Remember how with normal modifiers, all the words after the first modify the first?</p> <p><strong>pi</strong> changes that, but only a bit. The first word after pi is a new head, and the words after that modify that first word.</p> <p>Then, the whole thing goes on to modify the head of the current phrase.</p> <p>[direction: draw arrows from pona to toki, then pi toki pona to sona]</p> <p>Altogether, our interpretation is something like “a star gives Toki Pona knowledge.” Hey, that sounds familiar!</p> <p>But this is new to us, so let’s try another example:</p> <blockquote> <p>[akesi pi selo kiwen li moku]</p> </blockquote> <p>Here, the word <strong>akesi</strong>, reptile or amphibian, is the head of the subject.</p> <p>Then pi comes, and turns <strong>selo</strong>, skin, wall, boundary, into another head.</p> <p><strong>kiwen</strong> modifies that like normal- so we have <strong>selo kiwen</strong>, tough skin.</p> <p>And putting it all together, we have akesi pi selo kiwen- a tough-skinned lizard!</p> <p>Everything after pi is one big, fancy modifier for the head of the phrase. Otherwise, it works just like normal modifiers!</p> <hr> <p>Quick note: Using one pi is almost always enough. Using two pi comes up rarely.</p> <p>Any more than that, and you might want to take a step back and rethink your sentence. In fact, do that for just two pi.</p> <p>The same applies to complex phrases without pi- if you have one phrase with more than four words, or lots of extra use of li or e, you might be cramming your sentence!</p> <p>Toki Pona focuses on simplicity for a reason. Lean into it! Practice having shorter, more focused sentences.</p> <p>We’re gonna try that with the idea from the previous sentence- but not breaking it up in the way you think!</p> <blockquote> <p><span class=tokipona>akesi ni li jo e selo kiwen</span></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><span class=tokipona>ona li moku</span></p> </blockquote> <p>Now, you might complain that the new sentence is longer.</p> <p>But it gives us more information, and more clarity, at the same time.</p> <p>The first sentence gets rid of pi, instead describing the akesi with a sentence in full, rather than cram that info into modifiers.</p> <p>Then the second sentence is basically the same as before, but the subject can be just “ona” because we just talked about the akesi.</p> <p>The grammar is there to help you. It helps you organize your thoughts. pi is helpful, but sometimes it obscures the benefits of the rest of the grammar.</p> <hr> <p>By the way, if you remember our bonus from last time about asking questions with <strong>seme</strong>, you can do that with pi too:</p> <blockquote> <p><span class=tokipona>sina pali pi wawa seme?</span></p> </blockquote> <p>This is something like “You’re working with what strength?” Or interpreting a little more, maybe “How hard are you working?”</p> <p><strong>seme</strong> can go wherever you need it to!</p> <hr> <p>I’d like to end this lesson with another bonus: we’re gonna ask questions, but this time with verb doubling.</p> <p>If you’ve looked over the word list for Toki Pona, you might have noticed that there aren’t any words for yes or no.</p> <p>What we do instead is double the first word of the verb, then put <strong>ala</strong> between them.</p> <blockquote> <p><span class=tokipona>supa li lete ala lete?</span></p> </blockquote> <p>This is the closest thing to a yes-or-no question in Toki Pona.</p> <p>Interpreting this literally, you might say “is the floor cold or not cold?”</p> <p>And to answer, you repeat the verb for yes: <strong>lete</strong></p> <p>Or you’d say <strong>ala</strong> for no.</p> <p>Let’s try another:</p> <blockquote> <p><span class=tokipona>kala li kute ala kute e mi?</span></p> </blockquote> <p>This question doesn’t ask about a specific part of the sentence.</p> <p>This could be “Did a <em>fish</em> hear me?” or “<em>Did</em> the fish hear me?” or “Did the fish hear <em>me</em>?”</p> <p>You’ll have to rely on context to know exactly what’s being asked about!</p> <hr> <p>One last bit, a little related to the questions!</p> <p>Something fun about Toki Pona is that you’ll hear speakers repeat what eachother say. For example:</p> <blockquote> <p><span class=tokipona>kasi ni li suli a</span></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><span class=tokipona>suli wawa a!</span></p> </blockquote> <p>This is a lot like how answering “yes” to questions works- the second statement is not just an acknowledgement, but an agreement! Experiment with this!</p> <hr> <p>That’s all for today’s lesson!
