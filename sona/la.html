example has more information than just a translation beneath! All of them include extra info on how to think about a certain phrase, what other ideas it is comparable to, and much more.</p></div><h4 id=intro-to-la>Intro to la</h4><p><span class=tokipona>la</span> is Toki Pona's most complex piece of grammar. But it's still simple like the rest of the language, so let's dig in!</p><p>First, <span class=tokipona>la</span> is about context. When does something happen? What is it related to? <span class=tokipona>la</span> tells you that when one thing is going on, another thing happens.</p><p>The thing before <span class=tokipona>la</span> is a condition for the thing after it, like <strong>if</strong> and <strong>then</strong> working together in English. This may be a requirement, such as if the thing after <span class=tokipona>la</span> <em>only</em> happens when the thing before <span class=tokipona>la</span> does! It can also be where, when, or why something happens, like prepositions. Sometimes, it can be two statements only related by happening at the same time! <span class=tokipona>la</span> is very broad, but there are many useful patterns you can pick up on to better understand them.</p><p>When reading <span class=tokipona>la</span> phrases, it's helpful to think of them like this:</p><blockquote><p><strong>[1] <span class=tokipona>la</span> [2]</strong></p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>In the context of <strong>[1]</strong>, <strong>[2]</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If <strong>[1]</strong>, then <strong>[2]</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Because of <strong>[1]</strong>, <strong>[2]</strong> happens.</p></blockquote><p>Keep these shorthands in mind as we explore the different ways <span class=tokipona>la</span> can be used!</p><h4 id=phrases-and-la>Phrases and la</h4><div class=info><p>Feel free to skip around! There are many examples here, each with different perspectives on how <span class=tokipona>la</span> works. But be sure to read them all by the end!</p></div><hr><h5 id=la-and-perspective>la and perspective</h5><p>The context could be a subject or object, such as a person or thing. This is useful for discussing perspective, like the preposition <span class=tokipona>tawa</span>:</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>mi la sina sewi lon utala!</span></summary><p>To me, you'll win in the fight!</p><p>In my opinion, you're going to win the competition!</p><div class=info><p>Here is a restatement using <strong><span class=tokipona>tawa</span></strong>:</p><p><span class=tokipona>sina sewi lon utala tawa mi</span></p></div></details><p>Here, the <span class=tokipona>la</span> phrase has <span class=tokipona>mi</span> in it- this could mean "in my opinion" or "in my perspective". <span class=tokipona>mi</span> being context for the rest of the sentence is a way of saying that something is relevant to the speaker- relevant to you! Check under the spoiler for your understanding.</p><hr><h5 id=la-and-location>la and location</h5><p>But the context isn't limited to people or things- it can also be places, like with the preposition <span class=tokipona>lon</span>:</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>sewi la sina ken lukin e suno mute</span></summary><p>In the sky, you can see many lanterns!</p><p>In the rafters, you can see lots of lights.</p><div class=info><p>Here's a restatement that uses <strong><span class=tokipona>lon</span></strong>:</p><p><span class=tokipona>sina ken lukin e suno mute lon sewi</span></p></div></details><p>Here, <span class=tokipona>sewi</span> is the context. Since <span class=tokipona>sewi</span> is often a location, this could refer to where something happens, or where something is! This isn't the only interpretation though. Check under the spoiler!</p><hr><h5 id=la-and-cause>la and cause</h5><p>The context could be an action or idea too, and refer to cause and effect like the preposition <span class=tokipona>tan</span>:</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>pali sina la jan mute li kama pona</span></summary><p>You worked, so people healed!</p><p>Because of your work, many people have gotten better.</p><div class=info><p>This is similar to using <strong><span class=tokipona>tan</span></strong>!</p><p><span class=tokipona>jan mute li kama pona tan pali sina</span></p></div></details><p>Here, the context <span class=tokipona>pali</span> is an action- working or creating. The <span class=tokipona>la</span> phrase refers to cause: <span class=tokipona>pali</span> must happen for everything else to happen! Even this works like one of the prepositions- <strong>most phrases in <span class=tokipona>la</span> work like one of the prepositions</strong>! This doesn't work every time, but it can help your understanding go far!</p><hr><h5 id=la-and-description>la and description</h5><p>The context in <span class=tokipona>la</span> could be a description, which is especially useful for contrast:</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>laso la kasi li pilin pona. loje la kasi li kama moli.</span></summary><p>When green, plants feel good. When red/brown, plants die.</p><p>Green plants are healthy. Red plants are dying.</p><div class=info><p>Contrast is one of the most important ways to express complex ideas in Toki Pona!</p></div></details><p>Here, two contexts are used in separate sentences to explain a deeper idea! They each give context for their respective sentences, and together give more information than either one alone. The first sentence uses <span class=tokipona>laso</span>: "If green, then...", and that is contrasted with <span class=tokipona>loje</span>: "If red, then..." Check under the spoiler for the translation!</p><div class=info><p>Fun fact: these sentences are the least like the prepositions. Instead, these sentences have context that works a lot like <strong>modifiers</strong>!</p></div><hr><h5 id=la-and-feelings>la and feelings</h5><p>Sometimes, the context will be the speaker's opinion or feelings about the main sentence, like an interjection:</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>ike la soweli mi li moku e lipu sona mi!</span></summary><p>Unfortunately, my dog ate my homework!</p><p>Upsetting! My cats chewed up my textbook!</p><div class=info><p>Here's another version with <span class=tokipona>ike</span> as an interjection:</p><p><span class=tokipona>ike! soweli mi li moku e lipu sona mi!</span></p></div></details><p>And here, the context <span class=tokipona>ike</span> tells us how the speaker feels about the statement. It's like an interjection!</p><hr><h5 id=la-and-meaning>la and meaning</h5><p>Sometimes, it won't be clear what the context is when you hear it. It could be a place, object, action, description, or many more things- and that's okay!</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>utala la mi pana e kiwen!</span></summary><ul><li>In a fight, I threw a rock!</li><li>In the context of fighting, I give a rock.</li></ul><div class=info><p>The context completely changes the interpretation here! Without <span class=tokipona>utala</span>, most listeners wouldn't assume the rock is being thrown. With it, this is a fight!</p></div></details><p>Here, <span class=tokipona>utala</span> works like a location, idea, or action depending on perspective. This is all about interpretation, but the result is the same: the main sentence happens in the context of a fight!</p><hr><h5 id=la-and-whole-prepositions>la and whole prepositions</h5><p>Lastly, you can have any full prepositional phrase in <span class=tokipona>la</span>! This is the same as having that phrase at the end of the sentence, how we learned it before:</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>lon tomo la mi lape</span></summary><p>In a home, I sleep.</p><div class=info><p>Here's the same statement without <span class=tokipona>la</span>!</p><p><span class=tokipona>mi lape lon tomo</span></p></div></details><p>This is exactly the same as having the preposition at the end of the sentence- so why would you use it? For style, for fun, maybe because it feels more clear! This is a choice you have more than anything else.</p><p>Because so many <span class=tokipona>la</span> phrases are similar to prepositional phrases, you can often drop the preposition itself and have the same meaning as with it. This especially applies to <span class=tokipona>lon</span> and <span class=tokipona>tawa</span>, and sometimes <span class=tokipona>tan</span> and <span class=tokipona>kepeken</span>.</p><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>tomo la mi lape</span></p></blockquote><p>This restatement without <span class=tokipona>lon</span> <em>can</em> mean the same as the above example!</p><p>Notably, <span class=tokipona>sama</span> phrases won't usually mean the same thing if you drop the preposition.</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>sama kasi la mi awen lon ma</span></summary><p>Like plants, I stay still on the ground.</p><div class=info><p>Here's the same statement without <span class=tokipona>la</span>!</p><p><span class=tokipona>mi awen lon ma sama kasi</span></p></div></details><p><span class=tokipona>sama</span> needs its preposition to be understood, but <span class=tokipona>sama</span> prep phrases can still be used in <span class=tokipona>la</span>!</p><div class=warning><p>Be careful- not using the preposition can introduce other interpretations! Be ready to restate yourself if somebody isn't sure what you mean!</p></div><h4 id=phrases-and-la-summary>Phrases and la summary</h4><p>That was a lot of information! Let's take a moment to review everything so far.</p><p>Think back to the start of the lesson, and this example of how <span class=tokipona>la</span> could be interpreted:</p><blockquote><p>In the context of <strong>[1]</strong>, <strong>[2]</strong></p></blockquote><p>When <span class=tokipona>la</span> has a phrase, it works most like this. Look back over the examples, and see how often this applies!</p><p>Otherwise, any valid phrase may be before <span class=tokipona>la</span>, and those phrases can act like almost any part of speech or function in Toki Pona! In short, the context can be any almost anything, so experiment!</p><p>These prepositional meanings are most common when <span class=tokipona>la</span> has a phrase. The other uses, such as cause and effect, are still possible with phrases before <span class=tokipona>la</span>. But cause and effect is most often expressed with <strong>full sentences</strong> before la, which are next!</p><h4 id=sentences-and-la>Sentences and la</h4><p><span class=tokipona>la</span> has one more important use: you can use a full sentence for context!</p><div class=warning><p><strong>Terminology note!</strong> When I use "sentence" in this section, I mean <strong>statements before and after <span class=tokipona>la</span></strong>. Here's an example of each sentence underlined: <span class=tokipona><u>sina pona</u> la <u>mi pona</u></span>.</p><p>You might see "sentence" used to refer to a complete statement including <span class=tokipona>la</span>- that's valid too, so be aware!</p></div><p>When you have a full sentence, it can express anything- so instead of breaking down many possibilities like I did with phrases, we'll work through several examples and build an understanding. Let's get started!</p><hr><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>sina pona la mi pona</span></summary><ul><li>If you're good, I'm good!</li><li>When you're well, I'm well!</li><li>You're happy, so I'm happy!</li></ul></details><p>Here, the context is <span class=tokipona>"sina pona"</span>, which you understand by now! The main sentence is <span class=tokipona>"mi pona"</span>, and you know that too! But with <span class=tokipona>la</span> between them, the meaning of the second sentence now depends on the first. You might say, "if <span class=tokipona>sina pona</span>, then <span class=tokipona>mi pona</span>". Check your understanding in the spoiler!</p><hr><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>jan li pona la mi wile lon poka ona</span></summary><ul><li>If people are good, I want to be at their side.</li><li>When people are good, I want to be close to them.</li><li>People are good, so I want to be near them.</li></ul></details><p>This is a bit more complex! Now we have a sentence with <span class=tokipona>li</span>, but that's okay. We note that <span class=tokipona>ona</span> in the later sentence refers back to <span class=tokipona>jan</span> in the first, and we can once again imagine the two working together like "if" and "then" in English. Here's a similar example with "so": <span class=tokipona>jan li pona</span>, so <span class=tokipona>mi wile lon poka ona</span>. Check the spoiler!</p><hr><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>kasi li moku e telo la ona li kama suli</span></summary><ul><li>The flowers drank water, so they became tall!</li><li>If the trees consumed water, they will be huge!</li><li>If the plant drinks water, it will grow big!</li></ul></details><p>Here, we have a statement with <span class=tokipona>e</span> before <span class=tokipona>la</span>. It doesn't matter how complex the sentence before <span class=tokipona>la</span> gets- the sentence after will still depend on the one before! But at this point, you should be comfortable with sentences like these.</p><hr><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>ona li tawa tomo la ona li kama wile lape</span></summary><ul><li>When they're traveling home, they get tired!</li><li>While they're going home, they want to sleep!</li><li>When they left for home, they needed to sleep.</li></ul></details><p>Sentences before <span class=tokipona>la</span> work the same with prepositions, pre-preds, and any other part of speech or function. Like I said, these are normal sentences, with all the same rules we've learned.</p><hr><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>sina kama kala la sina tawa telo</span></summary><ul><li>If you became a mermaid, you would swim!</li><li>When you're a whale, you travel in the water.</li><li>If you were a fish, you'd go to the water.</li></ul></details><p>If you remember back to the early lessons, there was a suggestion to ignore parts of the sentence, read what is left, then add back the ignored part. For example, with modifiers, you could look at only the first word, and go back for the modifier(s). You can do this with <span class=tokipona>la</span> too, but unlike modifiers which only get more specific, <span class=tokipona>la</span> changes the sentence. You'll need it! Still, this strategy can help you.</p><div class=info><p>There's a million different ways to express a sentence before <span class=tokipona>la</span>- I can't cover them all! But trust that, if you understand the sentences before and after <span class=tokipona>la</span>, you can figure out what they mean with <span class=tokipona>la</span> between!</p></div><p>By the way- sentences can get complex, both before and after <span class=tokipona>la</span>! It's generally better to break down speech into more sentences, but you can still have complex ones, so here's a really involved example:</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>jan li alasa e kiwen wawa lon tenpo suno ale la ona li pakala e ilo mute li kama wile pali ala</span></summary><ul><li>When somebody pans for gold all day, they'll break lots of pans, and want to give up</li><li>If everyone is looking for iron while the sun is out, they'll break their pickaxes and want to stop trying so hard!</li><li>The people were hunting for tungsten every day, so they broke their drills and wanted to quit!</li><li>People are searching for strong rocks the whole day, then they broke their tools and wanted to stop working</li></ul><div class=warning><p>All these different interpretations are just because of interpreting Toki Pona in English- the Toki Pona would only mean one thing in one context!</p></div></details><p>There's a lot going on here! An action, a time that action happens, and the effect of that action on the subject! The sentence before <span class=tokipona>la</span> describes a circumstance- what happened before, what will happen, or a hypothetical situation that could happen. The sentence after describes what that circumstance causes. Interpret each individually, then connect them as though "if" and "then" were used. Check under the spoiler for your understanding!</p><h4 id=sentences-and-la-summary>Sentences and la summary</h4><p>Think to the start of the lesson again:</p><blockquote><p>If <strong>[1]</strong>, then <strong>[2]</strong></p></blockquote><p>When <span class=tokipona>la</span> has a sentence, it most often works like this! The sentence before <span class=tokipona>la</span> is what causes the sentence after <span class=tokipona>la</span> to happen.</p><p>You can often interpret each sentence individually, then figure out what they mean together from that! And this generally expresses cause and effect.</p><h4 id=other-uses-of-la>Other uses of la</h4><h5 id=multiple-la>Multiple la</h5><p>You can have multiple consecutive <span class=tokipona>la</span> phrases, but keep them short for clarity:</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>ken la mi kama jo e ilo musi mute la mi ken pana e ona tawa jan poka mi!</span></summary><p>Maybe, if I get lots of fun toys, I can give them to my friends!</p><p>If possible, I will get several game consoles, and gift them to my neighbors!</p></details><p>You'll notice that one of the phrases is just a word, and the other is a sentence. Mixing the two is totally fine!</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>sina pali la, sona mi la, sina ken ni!</span></summary><p>If you work, then to my understanding, you can do this!</p></details><p>Here, the phrase and sentence are in the opposite order. Just as well!</p><div class=warning><p>It might be that both contexts apply to the last "main" sentence, or that the first applies to the second and the second applies to the last sentence. <a href=./mod-pi.html>Like when we learned about <span class=tokipona>pi</span></a>, context matters- but shorter sentences, and fewer phrases, are clearer!</p></div><h5 id=if-la-then-o>if la, then o</h5><p>You can combine <span class=tokipona>la</span> with <span class=tokipona>o</span> to make your instructions conditional. Here it works with a sentence:</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>sina lukin e kasi suli la o tawa nasin kiwen. nasin li tawa kulupu tomo</span></summary><p>When you see the tall trees, travel down the rocky road. The road goes to the city!</p><p>If you see tall trees, take the gravel path. The path takes you to the village!</p></details><p>These are the same as the <strong>if [1], then [2]</strong> way to interpret. But now, the "then" part is <strong>then do [2]</strong>!</p><p>It works with a phrase too, but it can be a bit less clear what you mean. Try this one out:</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>tenpo poka la poki kasi o lon supa</span></summary><p>Soon, the flower pot must be on the table.</p></details><p>Sentences are often more clear than phrases because they provide more information about when or why you should do something- still, experiment! Clever, brief statements can convey a ton of info.</p><div class=info><p>Check out <a href=./la-extras.html>my side lesson</a> for more tricks with <span class=tokipona>la</span>!</p></div><h2 id=exercises>Exercises</h2><h3 id=toki-pona-to-english>Toki Pona to English</h3><p>You meet an old man in a dark cave, close to your journey's beginning.

But the strong scent makes me feel ill!</p></details><p>You've never much liked the chore of shopping. To better convince yourself to go out and do the work, you buy yourself a treat on the way.

A friend texts to ask how it went, so you go to your garage to make them a gift. When you see them again, you hand them two fused soda cans with a perfect weld between them, and say this of your skill:</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tokipona>open la mi sona ala. pini la mi sona ale.</span></summary><p>At the beginning, I didn't understand. At the end, I fully understood.</p></details><p>You're sitting in physics, learning about how gravity works to keep objects on the ground.

It's not the only way you can think about how <span class=tokipona>la</span> works, and it's not necessarily the best way- this is a breakdown of how I see and teach this part of Toki Pona's grammar. You'll get different explanations from other speakers- so the best you can hope for is to have a good idea in mind that gets you close to right! And you'll know you're there when you read and understand the sentence.</p><p>Either way, the raw grammar still applies, and so do all these provided translations!</p><h4 id=summary>Summary</h4><p>As a short review, <span class=tokipona>la</span> comes in two forms:</p><ul><li>Incomplete sentences, as in phrases and individual words. Most often these are interpreted as "in the context of <strong>[1]</strong>, <strong>[2]</strong>". They can also convey condition like modifiers, or circumstance like prepositions!</li><li>Complete sentences, which can be as long and complex as any sentence without <span class=tokipona>la</span>! These are often conditional, interpreted as "if <strong>[1]</strong>, then <strong>[2]</strong>".</li></ul><p>This is a complete list of everything <span class=tokipona>la</span> does grammatically, but not everything it can do in meaning. Also, all the given English interpretations are only approximations of how <span class=tokipona>la</span> really works, and aren't perfect.</p><h4 id=la-and-expression>la and expression</h4><p><span class=tokipona>la</span> makes Toki Pona come alive with meaning and expression! So many new and unique things can be said with <span class=tokipona>la</span>, it's hard to imagine Toki Pona without this piece of grammar. You can describe circumstance, context, cause and effect, everything a preposition can do, and more.</p><h4 id=what-if-i-dont-get-it>What if I don't get it?</h4><p>If you're ever confused by another speaker's statement, try asking them what's up with <strong>Questions</strong> in the next lesson:</p><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>sina toki e ni lon poka pi nimi 'la': ... ni li toki e seme?</span></p></blockquote><p>And while you're at it, don't worry about not getting <span class=tokipona>la</span> yet. Most speakers say it took them the most time to understand <span class=tokipona>la</span> compared to all the other words and grammar. If you keep trying, you'll get it!</p><div class=warning><p>Remember, these lessons aren't comprehensive.
