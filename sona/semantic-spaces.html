And that birds are not real!</p> <p>Today, we’re gonna talk about <strong>semantic spaces</strong>. What are they? How do they work? How do they relate to birds, which are vey much fake? Let’s get started.</p> <hr> <p>The first thing we’re gonna do is check your intuition.</p> <p>You may not <em>know</em> what a semantic space is- but you <em>feel</em> it!</p> <p>Even if you’re not thinking about it, every time you use language, you’re “feeling” every word you use.</p> <p>Each word means something to you, and they usually mean something similar to the person you’re speaking to.</p> <p>But you’ve probably noticed before that this isn’t always the case- it’s very easy to end up in an argument about a word, only to realize you’re using that word differently from how the other person is using it.</p> <p>[TODO: move tomato discourse to here?]</p> <p>How does that happen? Doesn’t the dictionary say what the word means? Sure, one word can have multiple meanings, but we can tell which meaning is being used by context, right?</p> <p>Well, maybe. But what if we sincerely thought different things about what the word meant?</p> <p>Your personal experiences, opinions, and beliefs can change what you assume a word to mean.</p> <p>Multiple definitions give us obvious examples of this, like “score” referring to points in sports and games, but a page of music to a musician.</p> <p>But even single definitions of a given word can be subtly different, able to change based on context- not in unfamiliar ways, but in ways we may not even notice.</p> <hr> <p>So, what <em>is</em> a semantic space?</p> <p>Semantic spaces are the collection of meanings that surround a specific word.</p> <p>Not just a dictionary’s list of meanings, but all the times and places that word might show up to reference those meanings, all the real life examples of those meanings, and so much more.</p> <p>It’s like a big bubble, with a bunch of smaller ideas in it.</p> <hr> <p>As an example, think about the word “fruit”. It doesn’t mean banana, apple, grapefruit, or [TODO].</p> <p>It means all of those things- you could point at any one of them, shout “That’s a fruit!” and be completely correct. There’s that “big bubble” I was talking about.</p> <p>But it isn’t about correctness. It’s about what others understand when you say the word.</p> <p>If you point at a <em>tomato</em> and say it’s a fruit, there are plenty of people who will agree with you.</p> <p>But for one group of people, the <em>feeling</em> of a tomato is that it’s a vegetable! I mean, come on, you wouldn’t put it in a fruit salad.</p> <p>For another group of people, they’re aware of the scientific fact that a tomato is, specifically, a berry, and they are here to correct you. [TODO: fact check!]</p> <p>So this big bubble that is the semantic space of a word isn’t necessarily the same from person to person.</p> <p>It can change, it’s dynamic. And there is no better place to watch this in action than in Toki Pona.</p> <hr> <p>In Toki Pona, the definitions you’ll find in dictionaries work more like the fruit example than actual dictionaries: they’re lists of examples!</p> <p>We can observe this in lipu Linku, and in Toki Pona: The Language of Good.</p> <p>[TODO: example definitions from each]</p> <p>Lists of examples can never get across all the detail, let alone the differences from speaker to speaker. But this youtube video… obviously can’t do that either!</p> <p>But what we can do is take a closer look at some of the words in Toki Pona, and see <em>why</em> two speakers might disagree on what a word means.</p> <hr> <p>We’ll start with an easy one: a word that has changed meaning since Toki Pona: The Language of Good was published.</p> <p>According to lipu Linku, <span class=tokipona>akesi</span> means reptile, amphibian.</p> <p>In the Toki Pona Dictionary, Sonja noted that the word was being changed to no longer mean “non-cute animal.” There’s a link to her notes in the description.</p> <p>Wait, what?! Yeah, if we go back to the original Toki Pona: The Language of Good, <span class=tokipona>akesi</span> means reptile, amphibian, and non-cute animal.</p> <p>Today, basically everyone agrees that it just means reptile or amphibian. Snakes, turtles, frogs, [TODO: more].</p> <p>But some Toki Pona speakers who have been part of the community for long enough would have learned the old definition of akesi. Some of them kept using it!</p> <p>For these speakers, akesi could refer to such terrible creatures as boar, [TODO: more ugly creatures], geese, the monstrous yeti, this cat I found on the internet, and a raccoon who surprised me a little bit. Wuh!</p> <p>The semantic space of akesi isn’t just a little different- these examples are way outside what we’d expect today!</p> <p>Despite that, two speakers using akesi to mean different things could still successfully communicate. Let’s have a short conversation with ourselves!</p> <blockquote> <p>“toki, o lukin e akesi mi.”</p> <blockquote> <p>“a, ni li akesi ala. akesi o kiwen lili tawa pilin o lete lili tawa pilin. linja ona li suwi tawa pilin li seli tawa pilin!”</p> </blockquote> <p>“taso, sinpin ona li ike e pilin anu seme?”</p> <blockquote> <p>“…”</p> <p>“nn, lili a.”</p> </blockquote> <p>“ona li ike e pilin la ona li suwi ala. ona li akesi tawa mi.”</p> <blockquote> <p>“mi la, ijo li ken suwi ala li ken akesi ala.”</p> </blockquote> <p>“sona a. sina kepeken nimi seme tawa ona?”</p> <blockquote> <p>“mi la ona li soweli. linja ona en seli insa ona en… sinpin ona… li pana e pilin ni tawa mi.”</p> </blockquote> <p>“ni li pona tawa mi. o lukin e soweli mi!”</p> <blockquote> <p>“wile a! mi lukin e akesi sina.”</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p>Did you catch all that? Here’s a rough translation. I’ve kept the words “akesi” and “soweli” though, since it’s the point of the conversation!</p> <blockquote> <p>“Hi, look at my akesi!”</p> <blockquote> <p>“Uh, that’s not an akesi. akesi should be a little rough to touch, and a little cold to the touch. Its fur is soft, and warm to the touch!”</p> </blockquote> <p>“Buuut, her face is pretty scary, huh?”</p> <blockquote> <p>…</p> <p>“… A little bit.”</p> </blockquote> <p>“If she’s scary, she’s not cute! She’s is an akesi to me.”</p> <blockquote> <p>“To me, something can be non-cute and not be an akesi.”</p> </blockquote> <p>“That makes sense. So what word do you use for her?”</p> <blockquote> <p>“To me, she’s a soweli. Her fur and warmth and… face… feel this way to me.”</p> </blockquote> <p>“Sure, that’s fair. Have a look at my soweli!”</p> <blockquote> <p>“Sure! I’ll look at your akesi.”</p> </blockquote> </blockquote> <p>In short, these two speakers were able to talk about the different ways they use the word akesi, by talking to each other about the traits of akesi that help them figure out what is and isn’t an akesi.</p> <p>They have different feelings about akesi, but both can understand each other, and even use each others’ way of speaking to bridge the gap!</p> <p>The diffferent definitions they use didn’t stop them.</p> <p>Now, important note- almost nobody uses akesi this way. akesi li suwi. Buuut you <em>could</em> run into somebody who does, and now you’ll be ready!</p> <p>With that said, let’s move on. We have a few more words to cover, and we’re not even up to birds yet! [TODO: bad transition]</p> <hr> <p>Would you believe me if I said that even today, some words which have never changed definition still have different semantic spaces? It’s not because the word has changed without its definition being updated- although that has happened.</p> <p>No, it’s because the use of some words is a matter of perspective!</p> <p>A while back, I had a conversation with mun Mekuwi about nebulae.</p> <p>You know, the pretty, colorful clouds of <em>stuff</em> in deep space?</p> <p>Are they mun? Well, let’s check the definitions.</p> <p>From Toki Pona: The Language of Good:</p> <blockquote> <p>NOUN moon, night sky object, star</p> </blockquote> <p>And now, from lipu Linku:</p> <blockquote> <p>moon, night sky object, star | ALT glow, glowing light, light in the dark</p> </blockquote> <p>[ on the bar, start reading below]</p> <p>Actually, there’s an “ALT” tacked onto lipu Linku’s definition that… nobody uses! That’s a longer story than we have time for. We’ll continue without it.</p> <p>But otherwise, these two definitions are the same.</p> <p>So, what sort of things are mun? Well, <em>The</em> moon, stars in the sky, and the planets like Mercury and Jupiter, since they look a lot like stars from the ground.</p> <p>We can stretch a bit further for comet astroid meteor, the sun which is just an especially close star, maybe satellites we put out in space, and yes, even nebula.</p> <p>But wait. Nebulae are a bit different from all those other things, aren’t they?</p> <p>Sure, they’re a night sky object- but everything else I just listed has one body.</p> <p>Everything that makes up itself is joined together in one place. Nebulae are… big clouds of gas!</p> <p>In fact, that’s not the full story. The gas in nebulae is so spread apart, so thin, you couldn’t feel it if you were there.</p> <p>It may as well be empty!</p> <p>But if you were talking to an astronomer, or somebody especially excited about space science, they might tell you that kon is more appropriate than mun!</p> <p>Now, this doesn’t necessarily disqualify nebula from being mun.</p> <p>Nebula being mostly empty is a big difference from the mun we agreed on.</p> <p>But nebulae are still night sky objects, still mun by that measure.</p> <p>At the same time, there is a valid perspective that says that mun isn’t the best way to describe a nebula!</p> <p>A person who saw a nebula through a telescope once might call it mun, and describe its appearance with ko or suno.</p> <p>Somebody who’s read about nebula might also describe them as containing or being ko- dusty!</p> <p>But somebody who really knows their stuff will carefully describe them as kon, and probably give many more details!</p> <p>What we learn from mun is that your experience with something can change how you understand it, and thus, how you describe it!</p> <p>And this changes the semantic space of the word for you.</p> <p>Two more words to go! Let’s move on.</p> <hr> <p>Alright,</p> <p>Here’s the definition from Toki Pona: The Language of Good:</p> <blockquote> <p>NOUN fish, marine animal, sea creature</p> </blockquote> <p>Checking lipu Linku- yep, same definition. Great!</p> <hr> <p>So now, we get to the most important category of this lesson. <span class=tokipona>waso</span>.</p> <p><span class=tokipona>waso</span> means bird, flying creature, winged animal.</p> <p>That definition comes from lipu Linku, which pulled it from Toki Pona: The Language of Good.</p> <p>Bird is pretty easy, right? We know birds. Like all these birds:</p> <p>They fly, they have wings. They even have lots and lots of bird traits, like beaks, feathers, talons, and being fake.</p> <p>But another important part of the semantic space is flying creatures, which don’t have to be birds:</p> <p>So those are waso too! Some of them overlap with other critter words- the flying squirrel is a soweli, the flying fish is a kala, and thhe pterodactyl is an akesi. But that doesn’t make them any less waso!</p> <p>We can go even further though. Is an airplane a waso?</p> <p>Well, it isn’t a creature, but it does fly. Is that enough to call it a waso?</p> <p>And how about creatures that are birds, but can’t fly?</p> <p>Are they <span class=tokipona>waso</span>? Some speakers would say no, because they can’t fly.</p> <hr> <p>There you have it. Birds are not real. In fact, words as you knew them are not real.</p> <p>Words are a mess in a beautiful way.</p> <p>So the next time you get into a debate about the definition of a word, take a step back and ask yourself,</p> <p>Thanks to jan Tekinowi for the thumbnail of this video, and thank you all so much for learning!
