And about birds. Because they are not real.</p><p>Today, we're gonna talk about <strong>semantic spaces</strong>. What are they? How do they work? How do they relate to birds, which are very much fake? Let's get started.</p><hr><p>The first thing we're gonna do is check your intuition.</p><p>You may not <em>know</em> what a semantic space is- but you <em>feel</em> it!</p><p>Even if you're not thinking about it, every time you use language, you're "feeling" every word you use.</p><p>Each word means something to you, and usually means something similar to the person you're speaking to.</p><p>But you've probably noticed before that this isn't always the case- it's easy to get into an argument over a word, and realize later that you're using that word differently from how the other person is using it.</p><p>How does that happen? Doesn't the dictionary say what the word means?</p><p>Well, maybe. But what if you and I sincerely thought different things about what the word meant?</p><p>When a word has multiple definitions, we can see this clearly: the word "score" refers to points in sports and games, but a musician would think of sheet music.</p><p>You can tell these apart by context- but it's easy to hear the word and think of the wrong meaning at first!</p><p>Your personal experiences, opinions, and beliefs can change what you assume a word means when you hear it.</p><p>And it doesn't stop there- even single definitions of a word can be subtly different, able to change based on context and experience- in ways we may not even notice.</p><p>How do we get through even one conversation, then?</p><p>My goal is to give you a way to think about this particular challenge of communication. And hopefully, it will make you a better communicator!</p><hr><p>So, what <em>is</em> a semantic space?</p><p>Semantic spaces are the collection of meanings that surround a word.</p><p>But those meanings don't come from a dictionary- they come from context, experience, culture, and much more.</p><p>You hear or see the word at the same time as its meaning, over and over.</p><p>And from that, you connect the collection of sounds or symbols with that meaning.</p><p>Think of "book".</p><p>You could see a book on a shelf, in a haunted house, or thrown into a river,</p><p>And you'd still know it was a book.</p><p>We know a book when we see it, because we've seen the word with its meaning so many times.</p><hr><p>But it's not just you experiencing words- everyone does.</p><p>Think of "fruit". It doesn't mean banana, apple, jabuticaba, or lemon.</p><p>It refers to all of those things- you could point at any of them, shout "That's a fruit!" and be correct.</p><p>But it isn't about being correct. It's about what others understand when you say the word.</p><p>If you point at a <em>tomato</em> and say it's a fruit, there are plenty of people who will agree with you.</p><p>But for one group of people, the <em>feeling</em> of a tomato is that it's a vegetable! I mean, come on, you wouldn't put it in a fruit salad.</p><p>Another group of people will remind you of the scientific fact that a tomato is, in fact, a berry. We call these people nerds.</p><p>What we learn from this is that semantic spaces are different to different people, because of what you know, and what contexts you see the word in.</p><p>Your experiences in life make a word- and your experiences are never like somebody else's.</p><p>And there is no better place to watch this in action than in Toki Pona.</p><hr><p>In Toki Pona, the definitions you'll find in dictionaries work more like the fruit example than actual dictionaries: they're lists of examples!</p><p>We can observe this in lipu Linku, and in Toki Pona: The Language of Good.</p><p>[TODO: example definitions from each]</p><p>Lists of examples can never get across all the detail, let alone the differences from speaker to speaker. But this youtube video... obviously can't do that either!</p><p>But what we can do is take a closer look at some of the words in Toki Pona, and see <em>why</em> two speakers might disagree on what a word means.</p><hr><p>We'll start with an easy one: a word that has changed meaning since Toki Pona: The Language of Good was published.</p><p>According to lipu Linku, <span class=tokipona>akesi</span> means reptile, amphibian.</p><p>In the Toki Pona Dictionary, Sonja noted that the word was being changed to no longer mean "non-cute animal." There's a link to her notes in the description.</p><p>Wait, what?! Yeah, if we go back to the original Toki Pona: The Language of Good, <span class=tokipona>akesi</span> means reptile, amphibian, and non-cute animal.</p><p>Today, basically everyone agrees that it just means reptile or amphibian. Snakes, turtles, frogs, [TODO: more].</p><p>But some Toki Pona speakers who have been part of the community for long enough would have learned the old definition of akesi. Some of them kept using it!</p><p>For these speakers, akesi could refer to such terrible creatures as boar, [TODO: more ugly creatures], geese, the monstrous yeti, this cat I found on the internet, and a raccoon who surprised me a little bit. Wuh!</p><p>The semantic space of akesi isn't just a little different- these examples are way outside what we'd expect today!</p><p>Despite that, two speakers using akesi to mean different things could still successfully communicate. Let's have a short conversation with ourselves!</p><blockquote><p>"toki, o lukin e akesi mi."</p><blockquote><p>"a, ni li akesi ala. akesi o kiwen lili tawa pilin o lete lili tawa pilin. linja ona li suwi tawa pilin li seli tawa pilin!"</p></blockquote><p>"taso, sinpin ona li ike e pilin anu seme?"</p><blockquote><p>"..."</p><p>"nn, lili a."</p></blockquote><p>"ona li ike e pilin la ona li suwi ala. ona li akesi tawa mi."</p><blockquote><p>"mi la, ijo li ken suwi ala li ken akesi ala."</p></blockquote><p>"sona a. sina kepeken nimi seme tawa ona?"</p><blockquote><p>"mi la ona li soweli. linja ona en seli insa ona en... sinpin ona... li pana e pilin ni tawa mi."</p></blockquote><p>"ni li pona tawa mi. o lukin e soweli mi!"</p><blockquote><p>"wile a! mi lukin e akesi sina."</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Did you catch all that? Here's a rough translation. I've kept the words "akesi" and "soweli" though, since it's the point of the conversation!</p><blockquote><p>"Hi, look at my akesi!"</p><blockquote><p>"Uh, that's not an akesi. akesi should be a little rough to touch, and a little cold to the touch. Its fur is soft, and warm to the touch!"</p></blockquote><p>"Buuut, her face is pretty scary, huh?"</p><blockquote><p>...</p><p>"... A little bit."</p></blockquote><p>"If she's scary, she's not cute! She's is an akesi to me."</p><blockquote><p>"To me, something can be non-cute and not be an akesi."</p></blockquote><p>"That makes sense. So what word do you use for her?"</p><blockquote><p>"To me, she's a soweli. Her fur and warmth and... face... feel this way to me."</p></blockquote><p>"Sure, that's fair. Have a look at my soweli!"</p><blockquote><p>"Sure! I'll look at your akesi."</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>In short, these two speakers were able to talk about the different ways they use the word akesi, by talking to each other about the traits of akesi that help them figure out what is and isn't an akesi.</p><p>They have different feelings about akesi, but both can understand each other, and even use each others' way of speaking to bridge the gap!</p><p>The diffferent definitions they use didn't stop them.</p><p>Now, important note- almost nobody uses akesi this way. akesi li suwi. Buuut you <em>could</em> run into somebody who does, and now you'll be ready!</p><p>With that said, let's move on. We have a few more words to cover, and we're not even up to birds yet! [TODO: bad transition]</p><hr><p>Would you believe me if I said that even today, some words which have never changed definition still have different semantic spaces? It's not because the word has changed without its definition being updated- although that has happened.</p><p>No, it's because the use of some words is a matter of perspective!</p><p>A while back, I had a conversation with mun Mekuwi about nebulae.</p><p>You know, the pretty, colorful clouds of <em>stuff</em> in deep space?</p><p>Are they mun? Well, let's check the definitions.</p><p>From Toki Pona: The Language of Good:</p><blockquote><p>NOUN moon, night sky object, star</p></blockquote><p>And now, from lipu Linku:</p><blockquote><p>moon, night sky object, star | ALT glow, glowing light, light in the dark</p></blockquote><p>[ on the bar, start reading below]</p><p>Actually, there's an "ALT" tacked onto lipu Linku's definition that... nobody uses! That's a longer story than we have time for. We'll continue without it.</p><p>But otherwise, these two definitions are the same.</p><p>So, what sort of things are mun? Well, <em>The</em> moon, stars in the sky, and the planets like Mercury and Jupiter, since they look a lot like stars from the ground.</p><p>We can stretch a bit further for comet astroid meteor, the sun which is just an especially close star, maybe satellites we put out in space, and yes, even nebula.</p><p>But wait. Nebulae are a bit different from all those other things, aren't they?</p><p>Sure, they're a night sky object- but everything else I just listed has one body.</p><p>Everything that makes up itself is joined together in one place. Nebulae are... big clouds of gas!</p><p>In fact, that's not the full story. The gas in nebulae is so spread apart, so thin, you couldn't feel it if you were there.</p><p>It may as well be empty!</p><p>But if you were talking to an astronomer, or somebody especially excited about space science, they might tell you that kon is more appropriate than mun!</p><p>Now, this doesn't necessarily disqualify nebula from being mun.</p><p>Nebula being mostly empty is a big difference from the mun we agreed on.</p><p>But nebulae are still night sky objects, still mun by that measure.</p><p>At the same time, there is a valid perspective that says that mun isn't the best way to describe a nebula!</p><p>A person who saw a nebula through a telescope once might call it mun, and describe its appearance with ko or suno.</p><p>Somebody who's read about nebula might also describe them as containing or being ko- dusty!</p><p>But somebody who really knows their stuff will carefully describe them as kon, and probably give many more details!</p><p>What we learn from mun is that your experience with something can change how you understand it, and thus, how you describe it!</p><p>And this changes the semantic space of the word for you.</p><p>Two more words to go! Let's move on.</p><p>[kekan: walk off camera]</p><hr><p>Alright, a foreword for this section:</p><p>This way of speaking can be confusing to other speakers of Toki Pona! It isn't very common.</p><p>We're here to look at what's possible, not to say what should be done.</p><p>So to keep thing close to how Toki Pona is most widely spoken and understood,</p><p>I'll be capping off this section with a much less experimental example of the same ideas.</p><p>Now, it's kala time! Here's the definition from Toki Pona: The Language of Good:</p><blockquote><p>NOUN fish, marine animal, sea creature</p></blockquote><p>Checking lipu Linku- yep, same definition. Great!</p><p>But for some words, there's more to it than the definition you can find on lipu Linku.</p><p>As you spend time in the community, you'll gain a better intuition for the meaning of words than what can be taught from a dictionary.</p><p>And as you spend time in the community, you'll find many speakers experiment with words.</p><p>They will use these words in ways that aren't part of these definitions, but are natural and understandable extensions of these definitions.</p><p>In a sense, this is how speaking Toki Pona already works.</p><p>For example, here is the definition for lipu from Toki Pona: The Language of Good, which is the same one in lipu Linku:</p><p>[kekan: look to right for definition]</p><blockquote><p>NOUN flat object; book, document, card, paper, record, website</p></blockquote><p>"Leaf" is nowhere to be seen in this definition, but I think any speaker would agree that leaves are a very good example of a "lipu."</p><p>Most leaves are both flat and bendy, like most of the things in this list.</p><p>Even the items that aren't bendy are still flat, and so are good for writing on. This is why website is already on the list!</p><p>In general, it makes sense to look at things agree are lipu, find similar things, and call those things lipu. This is how <em>every</em> word works.</p><p>So back to kala, then. What kind of experimentation is going on?</p><p>What if we look at kala the way we just looked at lipu, taking the definition's examples of kala and then looking for similar things?</p><p>Well, all the lipu were some combination of flat, bendy, and good for writing on- with an emphasis on being flat.</p><p>So what are the most defining trait of fish, marine animals, and sea creatures?</p><p>You'll often see fins, gills, and scales, as well as common body shapes.</p><p>Even the sitelen pona for kala reflects this.</p><p>But those examples are too obvious, right?</p><p>This isn't much to experiment with. Is there something else we could focus on?</p><p>A lot of kala spend their lives in the water, swimming.</p><p>Hey, swimming. I can do that! I'm not very good at it, but I can.</p><p>If you're swimming, are you kala? You have that trait in common with most kala.</p><p>Or when you shower, you're covered in water. Does that make you kala?</p><p>Or if somebody got soaked by the rain and said "pakala. mi kala," would you understand them at first?</p><p>For some of you, the answer to all of these might be "no."</p><p>For some of you, you might understand these examples, but not personally use kala this way.</p><p>And for some of you, you might enthusiastically say, "Yes! That's me! That's how I speak!"</p><p>If you take a strict perspective, swimming, being in the water, being wet, these don't make you a kala.</p><p>Salmon, seahorses, whales, dolphins, maybe otters, those are all sea creatures or marine animals. They're kala!</p><p>But a person <em>isn't</em> a kala- they're just too far from what we'd say is a kala, right?</p><p>The difference is only about where you personally draw the line.</p><p>If you open yourself up to the dark side- I mean, more experimental ways of speaking Toki Pona, then people can be kala in the right context.</p><p>ona li tawa sama kala li kama telo sama kala la, ona li ken kala!</p><p>You can always decide for yourself how you'll use the words in Toki Pona.</p><p>Even if you don't experiment like this, this experimentation still has value as a thought experiment, a way to explore how you personally use the language compared to others.</p><p>And this brings me to the final, most important word we'll be exploring today: waso.</p><hr><p>This is where the fun begins.</p><p>Toki Pona and lipu Linku agree here:</p><p><span class=tokipona>waso</span> means bird, flying creature, winged animal.</p><p>Bird is pretty easy, right? We know birds. Like all these birds:</p><p>Seagulls, robins, parakeets, hawks.</p><p>Similar to how many kala had obvious fish traits, all of these waso have obvious bird traits: wings, beaks, feathers, not being real, talons.</p><p>But wait- there are tons of birds that have all these traits... but can't fly.</p><p>Ostriches, penguins, kiwis, and the long gone dodo, are all unable to fly.</p><p>They have wings, beaks, feathers, aren't real, and talons.</p><p>That's a lot of bird traits- but much like nebulae and mun, a speaker might see the inability to fly as enough reason to say no, these aren't waso.</p><p>If anything, penguins are a lot more like kala- they spend a ton of time in the water.</p><p>But another part of the definition is flying, and you don't have to be a bird to fly:</p><p>bats, flying squirrels, pterodactyls, flying fish, tons more- they're all able to fly, one way or another.</p><p>You might think back to kala and protest- swimming doesn't <em>have</em> to make you kala, right? Why does flying?</p><p>But flying is a lot harder than swimming.</p><p>All the critters I just listed can fly because their bodies are shaped a certain way, allowing them to fly, even if some of them can only do it for short distances.</p><p>Put another way- if you can fly, it's probably because you're already similar to a bird somehow.</p><p>But to step back for a moment, let's recognize that all the examples I just gave also overlap with other words!</p><p>The flying squirrel is a soweli, the flying fish is a kala, and the pterodactyl is an akesi.</p><p>If you accept that just flight</p><p>We can go even further though. Is an airplane a waso?</p><p>Well, it isn't a creature, but it does fly. Is that enough to call it a waso?</p><p>And how about creatures that are birds, but can't fly?</p><p>Are they <span class=tokipona>waso</span>? Some speakers would say no, because they can't fly.</p><hr><p>How do you know what a bird is?</p><p>It's not that there's some specific thing that is "bird" which all other birds are measured by.</p><p>Birds aren't real, because the word bird isn't even real.</p><hr><p>There you have it. Birds are not real. In fact, words as you knew them are not real.</p><p>Words are a mess in a beautiful way.</p><p>So the next time you get into a debate about the definition of a word, take a step back and ask yourself,</p><p>I'd like to leave you off with one last thought: A pile of baseball cards is a good example of a kulupu, but kulupu doesn't <em>mean</em> "a pile of baseball cards."</p><p>Thanks to jan Tekinowi for the thumbnail of this video, and thank you all so much for learning!
