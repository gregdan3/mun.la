       <p>toki a, jan ale o! mi jan Kekan San! mi wile pana e sona pi
toki pona!</p>
<p>Hey everyone, I’m gregdan3, and today I wanna teach you about Toki
Pona. A portion of this lesson is going to be in Toki Pona, so get
ready! And if you’re already skilled in Toki Pona, skip to this timecode
to listen!</p>
<!-- TODO: is this true? -->
<p>Today, we’re having another mini lesson, this time about an almost
unnoticeable mistake learners make when getting into the language.</p>
<p>It starts with an introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="tokipona">toki! mi jan [ken· kalama· nasa]
[mute:]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No problem here! I’m giving you two pieces of information: What am I
(jan), and what is my name (Kekan San)?</p>
<p>By the way, I’ve used my own name here, but I’m going to treat this
exercise like anyone’s name is there.</p>
<p>So let’s say we’re past introductions. What if I were telling you
about my hobbies, my skills, or my job?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="tokipona">mi jan pi pana sona</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmm… There’s nothing <em>wrong</em> here. This translation is
correct: I’m a person who knowledge-gives. A teacher!</p>
<p>But there is something wrong. Something subtle.</p>
<p>Why is <strong>jan</strong> here?</p>
<p>We already introduced ourselves- so you already knew that I was
jan.</p>
<p>It’s not <em>wrong</em> to say jan twice, but check how clean the
sentence is without it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="tokipona">mi pana sona</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Big improvement! Not only was <strong>jan</strong> redundant, it was
making the sentence a little harder to read.</p>
<p>We’re talking about something we do- so why not get right to it?</p>
<p>But can we do better? Let’s try this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="tokipona">mi pana e sona</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turns out, using <strong>jan</strong> was limiting us here too!</p>
<p>By trying to cram all those words into modifiers of
<strong>jan</strong>, we couldn’t clearly indicate that
<strong>pana</strong> was an action, or that <strong>sona</strong> was
an object.</p>
<p>By separating them, we can make sentences much more natural, and more
easily understood!</p>
<!-- trouble one: stuffing everything into a noun phrase doesn't work when the intended noun is itself complex. what if I were a highly skilled software engineering teacher? -->
<!---->
<!-- trouble two: the word jan, or your own head noun, is redundant. the listener already knows it! -->
<hr>
<p>A lot of you will already be familiar with this phrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="tokinpona">jan pona</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This phrase is often lexicalized- which means, to be reused with the
same meaning over and over. It becomes part of the lexicon, part of the
language as though it were a word.</p>
<p>I’m gonna call these stuck-words for ease of understanding, but
understand I’m still referring back to lexicalized phrases.</p>
<p>“jan pona” is one of the most common stuck words in Toki Pona, and
it’s used to mean friend.</p>
<p>You’ll hear people say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="tokipona">mi jan pona sina</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“I’m your good person”</p>
<p>When really they mean:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="tokipona">sina pona tawa mi</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“You’re special to me.”</p>
<p>“jan pona” means much more than friend, of course.</p>
<p>But more importantly, “jan” isn’t doing anything here but making our
sentence harder to understand! Just like before.</p>
<p>There’s a whole collection of stuck words like this, that start with
jan.</p>
<hr>
<p>So let’s undo it!</p>
<p>There’s a common ask where a newbie wants to translate the name of
their job into Toki Pona.</p>
<p>They might ask it like, “How do I translate ‘I’m a fireman’ into Toki
Pona?”</p>
<p>Let’s answer it!</p>
<!-- But think about this -->
<!---->
<!-- The important thing here is realizing that using "jan pona" to mean "friend" isn't the only problem here. -->
<!---->
<!-- There's a whole bunch of lexicalizations- all of them starting with jan, or at least your head noun- that work like this! -->
<hr>
<p>mi musi e musi Manka</p>
<p>mi musi Manka</p>
<p>Neither translation is wrong, but the former is redundant, and is a
little bit stuck on how English forms sentences.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’ll be introducing myself!</p>
<hr>
<p>toki! mi jan Kekan San. tenpo la mi pana e sona pi toki pona.</p>
<p>mi toki pona ala la mi pali e ilo wawa kepeken sona ilo kepeken sona
jan. ni li tawa mani!</p>
<hr>
<p>[english backtranslation goes here]</p>
<hr>
<p>Now, having heard all that, I think you’ll agree that [??]</p>
<p>The reason I put up this mini lesson is because <em>I</em> was making
this mistake with the word jan, not all that long ago.</p>
<p>In fact, you’ll spot it in my main lessons!</p>
<p>I like to be clever and concise with the way I write my Toki
Pona,</p>
