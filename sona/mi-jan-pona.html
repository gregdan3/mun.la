A portion of this lesson is going to be in Toki Pona, so get ready! And if you're already skilled in Toki Pona, skip to this timecode to listen!<p>Today, we're having another mini lesson, this time about an almost unnoticeable mistake learners make when getting into the language.<p>It starts with an introduction:<blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>toki! mi jan [ken· kalama· nasa] [mute:]</span></blockquote><p>No problem here! I'm giving you two pieces of information: What am I (jan), and what is my name (Kekan San)?<p>By the way, I've used my own name here, but I'm going to treat this exercise like anyone's name is there.<p>So let's say we're past introductions. What if I were telling you about my hobbies, my skills, or my job?<blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>mi jan pi pana sona</span></blockquote><p>Hmm... There's nothing <em>wrong</em> here. This translation is correct: I'm a person who knowledge-gives. A teacher!<p>But there is something wrong. Something subtle.<p>Why is <strong>jan</strong> here?<p>We already introduced ourselves- so you already knew that I was jan.<p>It's not <em>wrong</em> to say jan twice, but check how clean the sentence is without it:<blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>mi pana sona</span></blockquote><p>Big improvement! Not only was <strong>jan</strong> redundant, it was making the sentence a little harder to read.<p>We're talking about something we do- so why not get right to it?<p>But can we do better? Let's try this:<blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>mi pana e sona</span></blockquote><p>Turns out, using <strong>jan</strong> was limiting us here too!<p>By trying to cram all those words into modifiers of <strong>jan</strong>, we couldn't clearly indicate that <strong>pana</strong> was an action, or that <strong>sona</strong> was an object.<p>By separating them, we can make sentences much more natural, and more easily understood!<hr><p>A lot of you will already be familiar with this phrase:<blockquote><p><span class=tokinpona>jan pona</span></blockquote><p>This phrase is often lexicalized- which means, to be reused with the same meaning over and over. It becomes part of the lexicon, part of the language as though it were a word.<p>I'm gonna call these stuck-words for ease of understanding, but understand I'm still referring back to lexicalized phrases.<p>"jan pona" is one of the most common stuck words in Toki Pona, and it's used to mean friend.<p>You'll hear people say:<blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>mi jan pona sina</span></blockquote><p>"I'm your good person"<p>When really they mean:<blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>sina pona tawa mi</span></blockquote><p>"You're special to me."<p>"jan pona" means much more than friend, of course.<p>But more importantly, "jan" isn't doing anything here but making our sentence harder to understand! Just like before.<p>There's a whole collection of stuck words like this, that start with jan.<hr><p>So let's undo it!<p>There's a common ask where a newbie wants to translate the name of their job into Toki Pona.<p>They might ask it like, "How do I translate 'I'm a fireman' into Toki Pona?"<p>Let's answer it!<hr><p>mi musi e musi Manka<p>mi musi Manka<p>Neither translation is wrong, but the former is redundant, and is a little bit stuck on how English forms sentences.<hr><p>I'll be introducing myself!<hr><p>toki! mi jan Kekan San. tenpo la mi pana e sona pi toki pona.<p>mi toki pona ala la mi pali e ilo wawa kepeken sona ilo kepeken sona jan. ni li tawa mani!<hr><p>[english backtranslation goes here]<hr><p>Now, having heard all that, I think you'll agree that [??]<p>The reason I put up this mini lesson is because <em>I</em> was making this mistake with the word jan, not all that long ago.<p>In fact, you'll spot it in my main lessons!<p>I like to be clever and concise with the way I write my Toki Pona,</article><footer><h2 class=tokipona>o toki tawa mi</h2><p><a href=https://youtube.com/@gregdan3d><img src=/buttons/youtube.gif alt="@gregdan3d on YouTube"> </a><a href=https://github.com/gregdan3><img src=/buttons/github.gif alt="@gregdan3 on GitHub"> </a><a href=https://discord.com/users/497549183847497739><img src=/buttons/discord.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Discord"> </a><a href=https://gregdan3.t.me/ ><img src=/buttons/telegram.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Telegram"></a><p>Generated by my <a href=https://github.com/gregdan3/SWGIG>Static Website Generator I Guess</a>.
