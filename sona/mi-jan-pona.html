A portion of this lesson is going to be in Toki Pona, so get ready! And if you're already skilled in Toki Pona, skip to this timecode to listen!</p><p>Today, we're having another mini lesson, this time about an almost unnoticeable mistake learners make when getting into the language.</p><p>It starts with an introduction:</p><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>toki! mi jan [ken· kalama· nasa] [mute:]</span></p></blockquote><p>No problem here! I'm giving you two pieces of information: What am I (jan), and what is my name (Kekan San)?</p><p>By the way, I've used my own name here, but I'm going to treat this exercise like anyone's name is there.</p><p>So let's say we're past introductions. What if I were telling you about my hobbies, my skills, or my job?</p><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>mi jan pi pana sona</span></p></blockquote><p>Hmm... There's nothing <em>wrong</em> here. This translation is correct: I'm a person who knowledge-gives. A teacher!</p><p>But there is something wrong. Something subtle.</p><p>Why is <strong>jan</strong> here?</p><p>We already introduced ourselves- so you already knew that I was jan.</p><p>It's not <em>wrong</em> to say jan twice, but check how clean the sentence is without it:</p><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>mi pana sona</span></p></blockquote><p>Big improvement! Not only was <strong>jan</strong> redundant, it was making the sentence a little harder to read.</p><p>We're talking about something we do- so why not get right to it?</p><p>But can we do better? Let's try this:</p><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>mi pana e sona</span></p></blockquote><p>Turns out, using <strong>jan</strong> was limiting us here too!</p><p>By trying to cram all those words into modifiers of <strong>jan</strong>, we couldn't clearly indicate that <strong>pana</strong> was an action, or that <strong>sona</strong> was an object.</p><p>By separating them, we can make sentences much more natural, and more easily understood!</p><hr><p>A lot of you will already be familiar with this phrase:</p><blockquote><p><span class=tokinpona>jan pona</span></p></blockquote><p>This phrase is often lexicalized- which means, to be reused with the same meaning over and over. It becomes part of the lexicon, part of the language as though it were a word.</p><p>I'm gonna call these stuck-words for ease of understanding, but understand I'm still referring back to lexicalized phrases.</p><p>"jan pona" is one of the most common stuck words in Toki Pona, and it's used to mean friend.</p><p>You'll hear people say:</p><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>mi jan pona sina</span></p></blockquote><p>"I'm your good person"</p><p>When really they mean:</p><blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>sina pona tawa mi</span></p></blockquote><p>"You're special to me."</p><p>"jan pona" means much more than friend, of course.</p><p>But more importantly, "jan" isn't doing anything here but making our sentence harder to understand! Just like before.</p><p>There's a whole collection of stuck words like this, that start with jan.</p><hr><p>So let's undo it!</p><p>There's a common ask where a newbie wants to translate the name of their job into Toki Pona.</p><p>They might ask it like, "How do I translate 'I'm a fireman' into Toki Pona?"</p><p>Let's answer it!</p><hr><p>mi musi e musi Manka</p><p>mi musi Manka</p><p>Neither translation is wrong, but the former is redundant, and is a little bit stuck on how English forms sentences.</p><hr><p>I'll be introducing myself!</p><hr><p>toki! mi jan Kekan San. tenpo la mi pana e sona pi toki pona.</p><p>mi toki pona ala la mi pali e ilo wawa kepeken sona ilo kepeken sona jan. ni li tawa mani!</p><hr><p>[english backtranslation goes here]</p><hr><p>Now, having heard all that, I think you'll agree that [??]</p><p>The reason I put up this mini lesson is because <em>I</em> was making this mistake with the word jan, not all that long ago.</p><p>In fact, you'll spot it in my main lessons!</p><p>I like to be clever and concise with the way I write my Toki Pona,</p></div><div class=footer><h2 class=tokipona>o toki tawa mi</h2><p><a href=https://youtube.com/@gregdan3d><img src=/buttons/youtube.gif alt="@gregdan3d on YouTube"> </a><a href=https://github.com/gregdan3><img src=/buttons/github.gif alt="@gregdan3 on GitHub"> </a><a href=https://discord.com/users/497549183847497739><img src=/buttons/discord.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Discord"> </a><a href=https://gregdan3.t.me/ ><img src=/buttons/telegram.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Telegram"></a></p><p>Generated by my <a href=https://github.com/gregdan3/SWGIG>Static Website Generator I Guess</a>.
