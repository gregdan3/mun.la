If you use it, you may have to repeat yourself without it!</p></div><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>Transitive prepositional phrases are simple to demonstrate. If you understand prepositions and transitive verbs, you already understand most of what you need! Many transitive prepositional phrases can be understood without recognizing the verb as a prepositional phrase, though not all of them.</p><p>Spoilers have a restatement of their sentence that does not use a transitive prepositional phrase. These restatements are still imperfect; some subtleties may be lost, and I note these.</p><p>Also, I shorten <code>transitive prepositional phrase</code> to <code>tprep</code>. It's too long!</p><h2 id=overview>Overview</h2><p>Tpreps are prepositional phrases in the verb position (directly after <code>li</code> or a subject that is exclusively <code>mi</code> or <code>sina</code>), with <code>e</code> and some object following. They can be interpreted similarly to prepositions, and can be restated without a tprep, but they can save many words in a statement and are highly expressive.</p><p>A statement may contain multiple words without the use of <code>pi</code>. This applies even in the verb position, meaning <code>mi tawa mama sina e ijo</code> is valid- <code>tawa</code> takes <code>mama sina</code> here, as with normal prepositions. Importantly, this means that a tprep can break from the meaning of a pu interpretation of your sentence, since the closest similar pu sentence would have to use pi to understand that the words after your prep phrase are an object.</p><h3 id=tawa>tawa</h3><p>tawa as a tprep is primarily used to mean <code>to move to [something]</code>. tawa has other meanings as a prepositions, such as to/for/in the opinion of. However, these meanings are difficult to express with tawa tprep, since they would have to apply to some specific object; when tawa applies transitively normally, it means to move something, and never to change the opinion of an object, or the directionality of some interpersonal action.</p><p>Because of this, the transitive verb meaning of tawa is a more common interpretation of tawa as a tprep: <code>mi tawa e ijo</code> is <code>I move a thing</code>, so <code>mi tawa sina e ijo</code> is <code>I move a thing to you.</code></p><details class=details><summary class=summary>mi tawa sina e ijo</summary><p>mi pana e ijo tawa sina</p><p>mi tawa e ijo tawa poka sina</p></details><details class=details><summary class=summary>jan li tawa mama sina e poki</summary><p>jan li pana e poki tawa mama sina</p><p>jan li tawa e poki tawa poka pi mama sina</p></details><p>The restatements become much longer than the tprep-using original, as the preposition tawa is still needed to provide the same info.</p><h3 id=lon>lon</h3><p>lon as a tprep means <code>to make something exist [in some location or context]</code>. This is also derived from its meaning as a verb, where <code>mi lon e ijo</code> means something like <code>I make a thing exist.</code> Here, lon takes some specific context for where the thing is made to exist!</p><details class=details><summary class=summary>mi lon poki e soweli</summary><p>mi pana e soweli tawa poki.</p><p>mi poki e soweli.</p></details><p>Now compare to <code>mi tawa poki e soweli.</code> In the case of <code>tawa</code>, the interpretation could be <code>to the side of</code> or <code>near to</code>, even without poka. The tawa tprep can include moving to inside the container, but <code>lon</code> conveys that meaning much more clearly- and this applies both here in tpreps and in normal prep phrases.</p><p>Also consider <code>mi tawa poki</code> and <code>mi lon poki</code>!</p><p>Also, some transitive prepositions work similarly without the preposition such as in <code>mi tawa lape e jan lili</code> being similar to <code>mi lape e jan lili</code>. No harm either way, this is a normal restatement that comes from Toki Pona!</p><details class=details><summary class=summary>mi lon ma e kasi</summary>mi pana e kasi tawa ma</details><details class=details><summary class=summary>jan li lon tomo e kulupu mama ona</summary>jan li tawa e kulupu mama pona tawa tomo</details><p>Here, contrasting <code>mi tawa tomo</code> and <code>mi lon tomo</code> is a bit more interesting: <code>mi tawa tomo</code> feels more like <code>I travel to a building [and go inside it]</code> than <code>mi tawa poki</code> does to mean <code>I travel to a container [and go inside it]</code>. Both meanings are possible, with different degrees of reasonability depending on context. After all, context is critical!</p><h3 id=sama>sama</h3><p>sama as a tprep is very similar to its verb and prepositional uses, still applying some same-ness or referring to some sameness that is relevant to the conversation. Generally, it means to <code>make [object] similar to [something]</code>.</p><details class=details><summary class=summary>mi sama mama mi e pali mi</summary>mi ante e pali mi tawa ni: mi pali sama mama mi</details><p>For this, you cannot simply say <code>mi ante e pali mi sama mama mi</code> and get the same meaning! In this sentence, sama could apply to either or both of ante and pali, where the original sentence is clear that the sama applies to pali specifically.</p><h3 id=tan>tan</h3><p>Using tan in a tprep is odd. There are a few ways to interpret it, but all of them are either hard to follow or come up infrequently. It means either to <code>make [object] caused by [something],</code> or <code>attribute [object] to [something]</code>, and there is no consensus on which is best or more clear. I personally say tan tpreps change attribution, because the alternative doesn't make sense; the cause would suggest breaking cause and effect by altering the cause of something- which generally is not possible. However, making a <em>claim</em> about the cause of some occurrence is perfectly reasonable. That said, it is up to you which of these meanings you accept and interpret.</p><p>Since these two meanings are so distinct, I provide both restatements in the spoilers.</p><details class=details><summary class=summary>mi tan sina e pakala</summary><p>mi toki e ni: sina tan e pakala</p><p>mi ante e tan pakala tawa sina</p></details><h3 id=kepeken>kepeken</h3><p>Using kepeken as a tprep is the least useful kind of tprep, but it does have interesting consequences to consider. Normally, <code>kepeken e</code> constructions are discouraged, and considered to be meaningless; tpreps change this! Consider <code>mi tawa e ijo</code>: this would mean <code>I apply moving to ijo</code>. From this, we can say <code>mi kepeken e ijo</code> means <code>I apply using to ijo</code>. Then, if kepeken takes an object, it takes on a more helpful meaning: we apply the use of some object to another object. In other words, kepeken tprep is to <code>make [object] use [something]!</code></p><p>Check out <a href=./kepeken.html>kepeken vs kepeken e</a> for more info.</p><details class=details><summary class=summary>mi kepeken ilo e sina</summary>mi ni e sina: sina kepeken ilo</details><p>Here's an alternative to consider: what if we said <code>sina kepeken ilo tan mi</code> as the restatement? Here, some info is lost versus kepeken tprep. If you use a tool because of me, it isn't necessarily the same as me making you use the tool. You can use the tool because of me, without me having made you do so, such as if I were to make a mistake that you correct.</p></div><div class=footer><h2 class=tp lang=tok>o toki tawa mi</h2><p><a href=https://youtube.com/@gregdan3d><img src=/buttons/youtube_s.gif alt="@gregdan3d on YouTube"class=button> </a><a href=https://github.com/gregdan3><img src=/buttons/github_s.gif alt="@gregdan3 on GitHub"class=button> </a><a href=https://discord.com/users/497549183847497739><img src=/buttons/discord_s.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Discord"class=button> </a><a href=https://gregdan3.t.me/ ><img src=/buttons/telegram_s.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Telegram"class=button></a></p></div><script src=/sptoggle.js></script><script data-goatcounter=https://jankekansan.goatcounter.com/count async src=//gc.zgo.at/count.js></script></div></html>
