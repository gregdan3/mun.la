All <span class=tp lang=tok>pi</span> does is groups modifiers, but it isn't the only way you can do that. Most particles introduce a new head noun, which you can describe however you like with much more detail than a <span class=tp lang=tok>pi</span> phrase. If your grammar gets especially complicated, you can start a new sentence instead. Speaking Toki Pona depends on both of these facts! As such, you'll find it surprisingly easy to avoid using <span class=tp lang=tok>pi</span>.</p><h3 id=using-pi>Using <span class=tp lang=tok>pi</span></h3><p>If you use more than one <span class=tp lang=tok>pi</span> in a phrase, there are suddenly two different interpretations of the grammar which have different meanings. If that weren't enough, these two interpretations cannot be told apart in speech or writing- only in <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span>. When using multiple <span class=tp lang=tok>pi</span>, either of the following are possible:</p><p>First, each <span class=tp lang=tok>pi</span> can affect the head noun, and not each other.</p><blockquote><p><span class=tp lang=tok>mi jan pi (kama sona) pi (toki pona)</span></p></blockquote><p>This would be interpreted something like "I am a person of learning <em>and</em> Toki Pona." Importantly, the two descriptors are separate: This person is a learner, and they are associated with Toki Pona. They aren't necessarily learning Toki Pona!</p><p>Second, each consecutive <span class=tp lang=tok>pi</span> can affect the previous.</p><blockquote><p><span class=tp lang=tok>mi jan pi (kama sona pi (toki pona)</span></p></blockquote><div class=warning><p>The font rendering isn't perfect- there would be two fully-underlined <span class=tp lang=tok>pi</span> phrases in handwriting. For now, just note the lack of a break between them.</p></div><p>This would be interpreted more like "I am a person of learning Toki Pona." Here, the two phrases <em>are</em> related, so the translation demonstrates that: learning and Toki Pona are part of the same idea.</p><p>These examples are unambiguous because of <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span>, but this clarity isn't possible in the latin alphabet or in speech. Without visible markings of when <span class=tp lang=tok>pi</span> phrases start and end, you'd need either another form of marking (such as emphasis in speech) or sufficient context to tell which meaning was intended.</p><p>Or, you can restate the sentence entirely without <span class=tp lang=tok>pi</span>!</p><h3 id=removing-pi>Removing <span class=tp lang=tok>pi</span></h3><p>If you restate these sentences without <span class=tp lang=tok>pi</span>, you can remove the grammatical ambiguity created by it. For example:</p><blockquote><p><span class=tp lang=tok>mi jan li kama sona li toki pona</span></p></blockquote><p>This is a restatement of the first example sentence. There are now three verbs: <span class=tp lang=tok>jan</span>, <span class=tp lang=tok>kama sona</span>, and <span class=tp lang=tok>toki pona</span>, which all separately describe the subject <span class=tp lang=tok>mi</span>: "I am a person, and I learn, and I (speak) Toki Pona." Next example:</p><blockquote><p><span class=tp lang=tok>mi jan li kama sona e toki pona</span></p></blockquote><p>This is a restatement of the second example sentence. However, there are now only two verbs: <span class=tp lang=tok>jan</span> and <span class=tp lang=tok>kama sona</span>. The second <span class=tp lang=tok>pi</span> phrase is now an object, which better describes the relationship of <span class=tp lang=tok>kama sona</span> to <span class=tp lang=tok>toki pona</span>: "I am a person, and I am learning Toki Pona."</p><div class=info><p>You can use more than once sentence instead of using <span class=tp lang=tok>li</span> to extend a sentence! This is especially helpful if you express multiple <em>unrelated</em> ideas in one sentence. For example:</p><blockquote><p><span class=tp lang=tok>mi jan. mi kama sona e toki pona</span></p></blockquote></div><h2 id=examples>Examples</h2><p>Try to restate these phrases without <span class=tp lang=tok>pi</span>. You can look at my suggested restatement under the spoiler!</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tp lang=tok>mi jan pi pana sona</span></summary><ul><li><span class=tp lang=tok>mi jan li pana e sona.</span></li><li><span class=tp lang=tok>mi jan. mi pana e sona.</span></li></ul><div class=info><p>Even though this example didn't have two <span class=tp lang=tok>pi</span> phrases, I still recommend using <span class=tp lang=tok>e</span> here. Just like the walkthrough example with nested <span class=tp lang=tok>pi</span> phrases, the intent of the sentence is more clear when using appropriate grammar!</p></div></details><p>Here, <span class=tp lang=tok>pana sona</span> is a single adjective that modifies <span class=tp lang=tok>jan</span>. Using <span class=tp lang=tok>pi</span> joins all following adjectives into a single adjective, <span class=tp lang=tok>pana sona</span> describes <span class=tp lang=tok>jan</span>. If you wanted to break this up, recognize that both <span class=tp lang=tok>jan</span> and <span class=tp lang=tok>pana sona</span> describe the subject of the sentence, <span class=tp lang=tok>mi</span>- so the split up version should still describe <span class=tp lang=tok>mi</span>!</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tp lang=tok>mi tawa tomo suli pi kama wawa</span></summary><ul><li><span class=tp lang=tok>mi tawa tomo suli li kama wawa lon tomo ni</span></li><li><span class=tp lang=tok>mi tawa tomo suli li kama wawa lon ona</span></li><li><span class=tp lang=tok>mi tawa tomo suli. tomo ni la mi kama wawa</span></li><li><span class=tp lang=tok>mi tawa tomo suli la mi kama wawa</span></li></ul></details><p>Here, the adjectives behind <span class=tp lang=tok>pi</span> now modify something other than the subject- they modify the object of a preposition, here <span class=tp lang=tok>tomo</span>. This can also easily be broken up, with a separate sentence describing the <span class=tp lang=tok>tomo</span>. However, there is a purpose to the <span class=tp lang=tok>kama wawa</span> that actually goes back to applying to the subject! While restating this, ask yourself: What would you go to a <span class=tp lang=tok>tomo pi kama wawa</span> to do?</p><h2 id=takeaway>Takeaway</h2><p>You can always use Toki Pona's more simple grammar words to make a clearer sentence. Instead of trying to pack a ton of information into one phrase, let the information breathe by spreading it throughout a sentence or two with appropriate particles. You don't need to get rid of <span class=tokipona lang=tok>pi</span> entirely to benefit from using it less often, and thinking about how you could express yourself without it!</p><hr><div class=lessonnav><p><a href=/sona>Lessons</a></p></div></div><div class=footer><h2 class=tp lang=tok>o toki tawa mi</h2><p><a href=https://youtube.com/@gregdan3d><img src=/buttons/youtube_s.gif alt="@gregdan3d on YouTube"class=button> </a><a href=https://github.com/gregdan3><img src=/buttons/github_s.gif alt="@gregdan3 on GitHub"class=button> </a><a href=https://discord.com/users/497549183847497739><img src=/buttons/discord_s.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Discord"class=button> </a><a href=https://gregdan3.t.me/ ><img src=/buttons/telegram_s.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Telegram"class=button></a></p></div><script src=/sptoggle.js></script><script data-goatcounter=https://jankekansan.goatcounter.com/count async src=//gc.zgo.at/count.js></script></div></html>
