word "preposition" comes from these words marking times and place- the "pre" part is for the fact that these words come before positions.<p>Prepositions add context to a sentence. When using a preposition, you say the word and a phrase following it- the phrase is the context, and the word tells you what kind of context it is!<div class=info><p>Focus on <strong>where the preposition is</strong> in the next few sentences!</div><p>A preposition may appear after the object:<blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>suno li walo e kiwen <u><strong>tawa lukin</strong></u></span></blockquote><p>After the predicate, without an object:<blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>kasi li kama wawa <u><strong>tan telo pona</strong></u></span></blockquote><p>Or right after <span class=tokipona>li</span> as the predicate:<blockquote><p><span class=tokipona>ona li <u><strong>sama mi mute</strong></u></span></blockquote><p>Prepositions appear <strong>last</strong> in a statement. Keep that in mind!<h4 id=every-preposition>Every Preposition</h4><hr><h5 id=tawa>tawa</h5><p><span class=tokipona>tawa</span> is all about context, so watch carefully!<p><span class=tokipona>tawa</span> can describe moving toward a specific place or thing:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>mi <u><strong>tawa telo suli</strong></u></span></summary><p>I'm traveling <strong>to the ocean</strong>!</details><details><summary><span class=tokipona>ona li pana e sona <u><strong>tawa jan ante</strong></u></span></summary><p>They gave knowledge <strong>to different people</strong>.</details><p><span class=tokipona>tawa</span> can describe perspective, like English "to": description from the point of view of something or someone!<details><summary><span class=tokipona>ni li pona mute <u><strong>tawa mi</strong></u></span></summary><p>This is fantastic <strong>to me</strong>!<p>This is so good <strong>in my opinion</strong>!</details><details><summary><span class=tokipona>kasi ni li suli <u><strong>tawa jan</strong></u></span></summary><p>This plant is huge <strong>to people</strong>!<p>This plant is huge <strong>compared to people</strong>!</details><p>And <span class=tokipona>tawa</span> can describe purpose, like English "for": doing an action on something or someone's behalf.<details><summary><span class=tokipona>jan li pali e ni <u><strong>tawa sona</strong></u></span></summary><p>The person created this <strong>for understanding</strong>!</details><details><summary><span class=tokipona>mi ni <u><strong>tawa ona</strong></u></span></summary><p>I did this <strong>for them</strong>.</details><p>You can tell these different uses of <span class=tokipona>tawa</span> apart by context. For example, if the speaker is explaining why they did something, that would be about purpose. Or, if the speaker is giving their opinion, that would be about perspective. You'll get used to these different ideas as you practice!<hr><h5 id=lon>lon</h5><p><span class=tokipona>lon</span> is used for location, telling where or when something is!<p>This can be a place:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>kulupu li <u><strong>lon kiwen walo jelo</strong></u></span></summary><p>The group is <strong>on the yellow and white rocks</strong>!</details><p>It can also be about time, when or for how long something happens. This uses one new word besides <span class=tokipona>lon</span>, <span class=tokipona>tenpo</span>:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>suno li <u><strong>lon tenpo suli</strong></u></span></summary><p>The sun has existed <strong>for a long time</strong>.<p>It will be sunny <strong>for a long time</strong>!</details><p>And it can be about ideas, like subjects in a conversation:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>mi toki <u><strong>lon sona alasa mi</strong></u></span></summary><p>I am talking <strong>about my hunting knowledge</strong>!<p>I am talking <strong>about my searching knowledge</strong>.</details><p>All of these are different kinds of locations. Try lots of things out!<hr><h5 id=tan>tan</h5><p><span class=tokipona>tan</span> talks about the cause or origin of something. It is similar to "from" or "because of" in English.<p>This can describe some kinds of motion, or where something is from:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>mi <u><strong>tan kulupu musi</strong></u></span></summary><p>I'm from a comedy troupe!<p>I got here from the improv group.</details><p>It can also describe the cause of something:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>mi wawa <u><strong>tan moku pona</strong></u></span></summary><p>I'm strong because of good food!</details><div class=warning><p>Remember: <span class=tokipona>tawa</span> talks about purpose, while <span class=tokipona>tan</span> talks about cause. To tell them apart, ask yourself: is one making the other happen? If so, that's <span class=tokipona>tan</span>!</div><hr><h5 id=sama>sama</h5><p><span class=tokipona>sama</span> talks about the similarity of things. This may be to compare the subject to something:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>pali sona sina li <u><strong>sama pali pi mama mi</strong></u></span></summary><p>Your teaching job is the same as my dad's job!<p>Your programming work is the same as my mom's work!</details><p>Or to compare the subject's action to something:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>ona li ken tawa wawa <u><strong>sama jan wawa</strong></u></span></summary><p>They can move quickly, like a sprinter!<p>They can move powerfully, like a weight-lifter!</details><p><span class=tokipona>sama</span> covers all kinds of sameness- a little similar, identical, and everything between!<hr><h5 id=kepeken>kepeken</h5><details><summary><span class=tokipona>jan li seli e moku <u><strong>kepeken ilo seli</strong></u></span></summary><p>The person is cooking the food <strong>using a heating tool</strong>.</details><p><span class=tokipona>kepeken</span> means "to use". The thing in a <span class=tokipona>kepeken</span> prep phrase is being used by the subject, maybe for some action or maybe in general. That's it!<hr><p>Now that we've covered all the prepositions, here are some important notes about using them!<h4 id=right-after-li>Right After li</h4><p>You might have noticed that the prepositions are a little different if they're right after <span class=tokipona>li</span> / <span class=tokipona>mi</span> / <span class=tokipona>sina</span> or on their own! In the predicate, they describe the subject, such as an action the subject takes. Separate, prepositions describe where, when, how, or why the action happens- this still applies to the subject, but is a bit more indirect. Again, you'll get used to the difference, but it's right in the grammar when you need it!<h4 id=multiple-prepositions>Multiple prepositions</h4><p>When a prepositional phrase is complete, you can start another one. You can do this as many times as you want, but fewer is clearer. Some examples:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>ona li kama jo e pan suwi <u><strong>tan jan pi pali moku</strong></u>, <u><strong>tawa pilin pona</strong></u></span></summary><p>They received some cake <strong>from a baker</strong>, <strong>to feel better</strong></details><details><summary><span class=tokipona>ona li toki <u><strong>lon lape ona</strong></u>, <u><strong>sama mama pi jan mi</strong></u></span></summary><p>They talk <strong>in their sleep</strong>, <strong>same as my partner's dad!</strong><p>They talk <strong>when napping</strong>, <strong>like my friend's mom!</strong></details><details><summary><span class=tokipona>pilin mi li kama pona <u><strong>tan lape</strong></u>, <u><strong>tan tawa telo</strong></u></span></summary><p>My feelings have gotten better <strong>from sleeping</strong> and <strong>from swimming</strong>.</details><p>Otherwise, the rules are the same as with just one preposition!<div class=warning><p>The commas are present to separate the two prepositions. They aren't needed- just helpful!</div><h4 id=ala-and-prepositions>ala and prepositions</h4><p>You can negate prepositions by putting <span class=tokipona>ala</span> after the preposition.<details><summary><span class=tokipona>kiwen suno li <u><strong>tawa ala mi</strong></u></span></summary><p>The shiny rock is <strong>not for me</strong>!</details><details><summary><span class=tokipona>jan pali li <u><strong>kepeken ala lipu ni</strong></u></span></summary><p>The workers are <strong>not using this document</strong>!</details><details><summary><span class=tokipona>mi pilin nasa <u><strong>sama ala sina</strong></u></span></summary><p>I'm feeling weird, <strong>unlike you</strong>.<div class=info><p>This sentence doesn't clarify <em>which</em> thing is not similar- and that's okay!</div></details><p>This is so simple, you already got it!<div class=info><p>Stick to negating <strong>predicates</strong>, <strong>modifiers</strong>, <strong>pre-predicates</strong>, or <strong>prepositions</strong>. Clean and clear!</div><details><summary>A note about <span class=tokipona>ala</span> with other things</summary><p>Negating the subject (<span class=tokipona>jan ala li ...</span>) and negating the prepositional phrase (<span class=tokipona>... tan sona ala</span>) can give you a similar result to negating the preposition. <strong><em>Can</em></strong>.<p>Most of the time, it makes things confusing! What does it mean when <span class=tokipona>jan ala li kepeken sona</span>? Or when <span class=tokipona>mi tawa musi sama sina ala</span>?<p>The first is something like "Not-people" or "Non-persons" use knowledge. And the second is "I dance the same way as not-you." These can be confusing- make sure you clarify yourself with another sentence, or restate!</details><h2 id=exercises>Exercises</h2><h3 id=toki-pona-to-english>Toki Pona to English</h3><h4 id=one-preposition>One Preposition</h4><p>You're walking through a convention center, when somebody runs up and says hi! They know you from your outreach work, and are excited to meet you. They open up with:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>sina tan kulupu pi jan pana</span></summary><p>You're from the philanthropy community!</details><p>You're on a tour of a factory, watching how various household objects get made. As you walk, you observe marvelous machinery working hard- and then come across one machine in particular wielding another machine! You remark:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>ilo li pali e supa kepeken ilo ante</span></summary><p>The machine is creating furniture using other machines!</details><p>You have been using a new studying method for school work. The way it helps you dig through material is clear and concise, and you always feel like you have a good grasp on the concepts after. You recommend it to others, saying:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>nasin sona ni li pona tawa sona jan</span></summary><p>This learning method is great for people's understanding.</details><p>Every time you try to take a vacation, something comes up and you have to cancel. It's like the universe is conspiring against you. You've been planning a trip to the Bahamas for months, but your boss said you can't take the time off. You're starting to think they're doing it on purpose. You think to yourself:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>mi pali lon tenpo mute! mi wile tawa ma ante</span></summary><p>I work too much. I want to go somewhere different!</details><p>Your friend has been reading somebody's blog, and feeding you hints as to its topic as they go. You're not sure what it's about, and your friend won't tell you no matter how much you ask! Until one day, barely stifling a chuckle, they tell you:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>ma li supa sama supa moku</span></summary><p>The earth is flat like a dinner plate!<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_DfpQTRvyc"class=uri>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_DfpQTRvyc</a></details><p>Your teacher is emphasizing the relative size of the earth in comparison to other objects. This is an important idea for students to understand, because it helps them to put the earth's size into perspective. It also helps them to understand that the earth is a huge object, and that it is much larger than any one person. Your teacher says:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>ma li suli ala tawa sewi. ona li suli tawa jan</span></summary><p>The earth isn't large compared to the sky. It's large compared to people.</details><h4 id=multiple-prepositions-1>Multiple Prepositions</h4><p>You're back home again, feeling great because of your trip, but there's one thing wrong: you have a limp! You're in too good a mood to let it get you down, but one of your friends asked what happened. You explain:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>mi pilin ike tan tawa anpa lon tenpo poka</span></summary><p>I'm feeling bad because I fell down recently.</details><p>A close friend is going on a long trip, and doesn't know when they'll be back. They gave you something important to them- a bracelet they'd had for years. You try to refuse it, saying it's too important to them to give away. But your friend insists, saying:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>mi pana e ni tawa sina tan wile mi</span></summary><p>I'm giving this to you because I wanted to.</details><p>After quitting your job, you find yourself with brand new freedom. You cut down your expenses, sell some stuff, and start traveling with the saved money. When you get to your first destination, you realize something even better with great excitement! In a shocked, hushed tone you say:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>mi ken lon ma ale lon tenpo ale</span></summary><p>I can be in any place, at any time!</details><h4 id=ala-and-prepositions-1>ala and Prepositions</h4><p>You're sitting in class, learning about how plants have adapted to a variety of different environments. However, there are some environments that plants haven't adapted to, such as the cold and thin air on tall mountains! The teacher says:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>kasi li lon ala ma sewi</span></summary><p>Plants aren't on ground that is way high up!</details><p>There's a storm, and the wind is whipping past you at an alarming speed! As the storm comes in, the wind picks up ferociously, blowing the plants and the trees around. As you watch, you notice the shrubs and grasses being blown over without resistance, then rising back up. But the trees have their branches torn away. You remark:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>kasi lili li sama ala kasi suli</span></summary><p>The shrubs and grasses are not similar to the trees.</details><p>You're having a discussion with some friends about where you grew up, and how that influenced the way you think. For many of them, their life philosophies came from where they grew up, but you feel differently and say:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>nasin mi li tan ala ma mi</span></summary><p>My philosophy is not from where I was born!</details><p>You're trekking through a desert with a guide, stopping rest through the night. Your guide explains that you need to bundle up: the temperature of the desert depends on the sun, so the desert will become freezing when the sun sets. You ask a follow-up question: if it gets cold enough, will there be ice? And the guide explains:<details><summary><span class=tokipona>kiwen lete li lon ala ma ni tan ni: telo li lon ala</span></summary><p>There is no ice here because of this: there is no water.</details><h3 id=english-to-toki-pona>English to Toki Pona</h3><details><summary>Everyone is on the road.

You can now include a new phrase in your sentences, which occurs in the predicate, after the predicate, or after the object- last in the statement. Here are some examples of this idea:<blockquote><p>[subject] (<span class=tokipona>li</span>) (preposition [prep phrase])</blockquote><blockquote><p>[subject] (<span class=tokipona>li</span>) [predicate] (preposition [prep phrase])</blockquote><blockquote><p>[subject] (<span class=tokipona>li</span>) [predicate] (<span class=tokipona>e</span> [object]) (preposition [prep phrase])</blockquote><p>Keep in mind: if a preposition comes right after <span class=tokipona>li</span> it's still the predicate!<h4 id=new-ambiguity>New Ambiguity</h4><p>You may have noticed during the lesson that the word <span class=tokipona>tawa</span> is used often as a normal content word and as a preposition. It gets modified often too. Telling <span class=tokipona>tawa</span> preposition apart from <span class=tokipona>tawa</span> as a content word can be difficult!<p>Toki Pona doesn't have a way of telling apart modified <span class=tokipona>tawa</span> from <span class=tokipona>tawa</span> preposition. But the two can be told apart easily, especially as you practice. <span class=tokipona>tawa</span> near the end of the sentence, and especially after an object, is a preposition more often than not. <span class=tokipona>tawa</span> in the predicate is generally a modifier.<p>This applies to every preposition, but understandably, it affects <span class=tokipona>tawa</span> the most. If you're ever unsure, ask somebody for help with reading, or ask for a restatement when speaking!<hr><p><a href=./pre-predicates.html>Previous lesson</a><p><a href=./o.html>Next lesson</a></article><footer><h2 class=tokipona>o toki tawa mi</h2><p class=buttons style=display:block><a href=https://youtube.com/@gregdan3d><img src=/buttons/youtube.gif alt="@gregdan3d on YouTube"> </a><a href=https://github.com/gregdan3><img src=/buttons/github.gif alt="@gregdan3 on GitHub"> </a><a href=https://discord.com/users/497549183847497739><img src=/buttons/discord.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Discord"> </a><a href=https://gregdan3.t.me/ ><img src=/buttons/telegram.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Telegram"></a><p>Generated by my <a href=https://github.com/gregdan3/SWGIG>Static Website Generator I Guess</a>.
