I separated them to make them easier to remember.</p> <h2 id=overview>Overview</h2> <h4 id=instructions>Instructions</h4> <p>We’re going to look at another new sentence! We’ll use the particle <code>o</code>, so we can give instructions or set out requirements.</p> <p>The particle <code>o</code> is like <code>li</code>. It takes the same place in the sentence, but it changes the meaning: now, the sentence is an instruction!</p> <p>You may give instructions without a subject, which are directed at the listener:</p> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona>o lukin e kulupu kasi </summary></p> <p>Look at the forest.</p> <p>Look at the garden.</p> </details> <p>This is the most common form of an instruction, <em>without</em> a subject.</p> <div class=info> <p>In Toki Pona, it is not rude to give an instruction. If you say “o ni” as in “Do this”, it is as polite as “Can you please do this?” in English. There is no “please” in Toki Pona, and no need for it!</p> </div> <p>You may also give instructions to a specific subject:</p> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> jan lili o musi nasa ala </summary></p> <p><strong>If jan lili is listening</strong>: Child, stop being silly!</p> <p><strong>If jan lili is not listening</strong>: The child has to stop being silly.</p> </details> <p>If the subject is not listening or not able to listen, you would interpret the statement as a requirement instead of a given instruction.</p> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> lipu o pakala ala </summary></p> <p>The paper must not be torn.</p> <p>The documents must not be shredded.</p> </details> <p>This also applies to inanimate things! What does it mean to give instructions or requirements to a building, collection, light, or colors?</p> <p>You can also reword these as instructions:</p> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> o pakala ala e lipu </summary></p> <p>Do not tear the paper.</p> <p>Do not shred the documents. indicate</p> </details> <p>Now the listener is responsible for the paper!</p> <details> <p><summary> A note about politeness </summary></p> <p>It is possible to be rude in Toki Pona, as it is possible in any language. But in English, we soften requests with lots of extra words, such as please and can. In Toki Pona, there is an assumption that you are being earnest and respectful of your listener, so a request doesn’t need to be softened with other words. This is often called a “polite default” assumption, but I call it an “earnest default.”</p> </details> <h4 id=attention>Attention</h4> <p>You may use <code>o</code> directly after a subject phrase to get that subject’s attention:</p> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> mama o </summary></p> <p>Mom! [mom looks over]</p> <p>Dad! [dad looks over]</p> </details> <div class=info> <p>This is an interjection, which we’ll learn more about in the next lesson!</p> </div> <p>This may appear before or after a sentence, but both mean the same:</p> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> jan sona o・sina pona </summary></p> <p>Teacher, you’re excellent!</p> </details> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> sina pona・jan sona o </summary></p> <p>You’re excellent, teacher!</p> </details> <p>Here, <code>jan sona o</code> is getting the attention of <code>jan sona</code>, and the speaker says a complete sentence directed at them. The order of the sentence and interjection doesn’t matter, so do what feels right in the moment.</p> <p>You can use this interjection with an instruction, so you know that an instruction will be heard by its intended listener:</p> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> jan ale o・o pana e lipu sina </summary></p> <p>Everyone, please turn in your papers!</p> </details> <p>And you can put the two together, because an instruction with a subject can get the attention of that subject at the same time as instructing or requiring:</p> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> jan ale o pana e lipu sina </summary></p> <p>Everyone, please turn in your papers!</p> <p>Everyone must turn in their papers.</p> </details> <h4 id=taso-sentences>taso sentences</h4> <p>Sometimes you’ll see <code>taso</code> at the start of a sentence. This is like saying “but” or “however,” and is usually used before a <em>later</em> sentence to connect two ideas.</p> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> mi kute e pakala・taso mi pona </summary></p> <p>I heard something break. But I’m alright!</p> </details> <p>The first sentence establishes context, and the second provides some clarifying or contrary information.</p> <p>For comparison, here is the second sentence without <code>taso</code>:</p> <blockquote> <p><span class=tokipona>mi kute e pakala・mi pona</span></p> </blockquote> <p>Without <code>taso</code>, the sentences are not as clearly related.</p> <h4 id=taso-modifier>taso modifier</h4> <p><code>taso</code> is a modifier the rest of the time, but only as the <em>last</em> modifier of a phrase, affecting the entire phrase. Consider these examples:</p> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> kute taso li pona e sona sina </summary></p> <p>(Only listening) can improve your understanding.</p> </details> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> kute li pona taso e sona sina </summary></p> <p>Listening will (only improve) your understanding.</p> </details> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> kute li pona e sona sina taso </summary></p> <p>Listening will improve (your understanding only).</p> </details> <h4 id=taso-head>taso head</h4> <p>taso can also be the head of a phrase, used as a normal content word:</p> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> taso li pona </summary></p> <p>Being alone is good.</p> <p>Exclusivity is good.</p> </details> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> ona li kama taso </summary></p> <p>They became alone.</p> </details> <p>This is a rare use though; taso is most used together with other concepts!</p> <h2 id=exercises>Exercises</h2> <div class=info> <p>In previous lessons, I gave many interpretations for each sentence. As these sentences get longer and more complex, I provide fewer or only one interpretation, but there are other interpretations; try thinking of a few!</p> </div> <h3 id=toki-pona-to-english>Toki Pona to English</h3> <h4 id=o-for-commands>o for commands</h4> <p>You’re on a camping trip in the hills of a huge mountain range, and have a ranger with you to help the trip and provide knowledge of nature! You get back to your camp one night before sunset, and find a bear digging through your food. Oh no, you’ve gotta stop it! But the ranger tells you in hushed but serious tone:</p> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> o utala ala e soweli </summary></p> <p>Don’t attack the bear!</p> </details> <p>You’re on a boat with some friends, enjoying the sun and the wind. One of your friends has been intently watching over the side, waiting for… Something? Eventually, they call out to everyone to come look, because they spotted something! They say:</p> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> o lukin e kala suli </summary></p> <p>Look at this huuuuge fish!</p> </details> <p>Your neighbor somehow caught a bird, put it in a box, and is planning to keep it. Oh no, the poor bird! You explain to them that birds want to fly and be free, and tell them:</p> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> o poki ala e waso </summary></p> <p>Don’t put the birds in a box!</p> </details> <p>You’ve been frustratedly working on a piece of art for some time. It’s a painting you wanted to gift to your teacher, but you don’t think it’s coming out right and want to destroy it. You show it to one of your friends for advice, and they say:</p> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> <strong>o moli ala e sitelen sina・ona li pona</strong> </summary></p> <p>Don’t kill your painting. It’s fantastic!</p> <p>Don’t destroy your painting. It’s fantastic!</p> <div class=info> <p><strong>moli</strong> here is being used to mean the same as <strong>pakala</strong>, but for something which is important or meaningful. This is incorrect if taking <strong>moli</strong> at face value, but it is still a common use in the community!</p> </div> </details> <h4 id=o-with-a-subject>o with a subject</h4> <p>Your dad is leaving you at home while he runs errands. He wants you to clean the house, because you made a mess of the place not long ago, bringing in a bunch of branches from outside. He says to you:</p> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> palisa o jaki ala e tomo・o weka e palisa </summary></p> <p>Sticks must not make the house gross. Remove the sticks!</p> </details> <p>You’ve been hanging out on the porch for too long, and you’ve started to notice lots of obnoxious bugs coming out as the sun sets. In your frustration, you yell out at the bugs:</p> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> pipi o weka・o moli </summary></p> <p>Bugs, go away! Die!</p> <p>Bugs have to go away! And die!</p> </details> <p>You’re trying to play a board game with a group of friends, but only one of you knows the rules. The rest of you are sitting together, trying to make sense of the rules, when one of the group pipes up:</p> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> jan pi sona musi o pana e sona </summary></p> <p>The person who knows about the game should explain!</p> </details> <p>You’re explaining the rules to the game: When the leader covers their eyes, everyone runs as fast as they can. When the leader opens their eyes, if anyone is seen moving they’re out! You explain:</p> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> ona ale o tawa ala </summary></p> <p>They all must not move!</p> </details> <p>You’re in a cooking competition! The dish on order: authentic pasta. When the order comes in, you think long and hard about it; there’s a lot of competition. Your coach chimes in with similar thinking, saying:</p> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> pan sina o pona wawa </summary></p> <p>Your pasta has to come out <em>amazingly</em>!</p> </details> <h4 id=o-for-attention>o for attention</h4> <p>You spotted a cute squirrel, and you’re trying to get its attention!</p> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> soweli o </summary></p> <p>Hey squirrel!</p> </details> <p>You brought your friend out to birdwatch with you. They are much newer to the hobby than you, and keep scaring off birds with their calls:</p> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> waso o </summary></p> <p>Hey bird!</p> </details> <p>Your pet lizard absolutely loves to eat lettuce, tearing right into it. You wanted to show off for some of your friends, but it seems your little lizard friend has stage fright: he won’t eat in front of the crowd! You tell him gently:</p> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> o moku e kili・akesi lili o </summary></p> <p>Please eat the lettuce, little lizard</p> </details> <h4 id=sentence-start-taso>Sentence-start taso</h4> <p>You’re discussing hobbies with a friend, especially when you like to work on your hobbies. Your friend is a morning person and loves feeling the sun as they’re productive. You like the sun, but prefer to work in the dark when the moon is out. You tell them:</p> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> suno li pona・taso pimeja li pona e ken sitelen mi </summary></p> <p>The sun is good, but darkness helps my writing ability.</p> <hr> <ul> <li>Sunlight is okay, but the shade improves my writing performance.</li> <li>Lights are wonderful, but I prefer no lights for my writing.</li> </ul> </details> <p>It’s the middle of winter, and you’ve seen nothing but dreary gray skies for weeks. One day, the cloud cover finally breaks, opening up to reveal beautiful sunlight! You step outside to bask, but unfortunately, the air is still frigid around you. You remark to yourself:</p> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> mi pilin e suno・taso mi lete </summary></p> <p>I feel the sunlight, but I feel cold.</p> </details> <p>You’re a genius inventor, working on an amazing new tool: a working pair of wings you can strap to your back! When you come up with a working prototype, you demonstrate the invention in front of a crowd, explaining:</p> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> mi waso ala・taso mi ken tawa sewi </summary></p> <p>I am not a bird, but I can fly!</p> </details> <h4 id=modifier-taso>Modifier taso</h4> <p>Your friend has become quite philosophical as of late, and has been throwing various statements in their new philosophical views your way for review. The most recent one seems rather obvious to you, but you don’t let them know that. The statement:</p> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> <strong>ala li pona taso</strong> </summary></p> <p>Nothing is exclusively good.</p> <p>Nothingness is only good!</p> <div class=info> <p>This statement has two possible interpretations, even in the given context! It could be saying that <em>no object exists which is entirely good</em>, or <em>nothingness itself is exclusively good</em>. Maybe your friend is wiser than you thought?</p> </div> </details> <p>Your friend is down-trodden, feeling rejected. They haven’t been invited to any parties or events lately, and are worried that all their friends are abandoning them. As a way of lashing out, they insist their friends are the problem, but you console them with some helpful perspective:</p> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> jan pona sina li ike ala・ona li pali taso・ona li wile e sina </summary></p> <p>Your friends are not mean! They’re only working. They want you.</p> </details> <p>You’ve been thinking long and hard about an upcoming event. You want it to be the most thrilling event to ever happen in your city- but you don’t know to do it without the help of somebody you <em>really</em> don’t want to ask for help. But it’s worth it. You resolve to get their help, and say to yourself:</p> <details> <p><summary class=tokipona> ona taso li ken wawa e kulupu </summary></p> <p>Only they are able to excite the party!</p> <div class=info> <p><strong>wawa</strong> here is being used to mean “intensify.” It can intensify any anything!</p> </div> </details> <h3 id=english-to-toki-pona>English to Toki Pona</h3> <details> <p><summary> <strong>I only want the shiny black rock!</strong> </summary></p> <p><span class=tokipona>mi wile e kiwen pimeja suno taso</span></p> <p><span class=tokipona>mi wile e kiwen pimeja pona taso</span></p> <div class=warning> <p>This is a little tricky! In English, saying “I only want the rock” means the <em>rock</em> is the exclusive thing in the sentence, not wanting! When translated, taso only applies to the object.</p> <p>Otherwise, you would be saying “I am only wanting (and it happens to be wanting this rock).” Weird to think about, huh?</p> </div> </details> <details> <p><summary> They only have their id card. </summary></p> <p><span class=tokipona>ona li jo e lipu ona taso</span></p> <p><span class=tokipona>ona li jo e lipu jan ona taso</span></p> <div class=info> <p>Here, if <strong>jo</strong> were <strong>taso</strong>, it would mean they only action they were taking is having their ID card. What is meant is that the only object they have is their ID card!</p> </div> </details> <details> <p><summary> <strong>Make them stop!</strong> </summary></p> <p><span class=tokipona>o awen e ona</span></p> <div class=info> <p><strong>awen</strong> can mean to continue, or to stop. Here, applying <strong>awen</strong> to <strong>ona</strong> means to stop them!</p> </div> </details> <details> <p><summary> Can you wash the dog? </summary></p> <p><span class=tokipona>o telo e soweli</span></p> <div class=info> <p>Remember, instructions are just as good as requests in Toki Pona!</p> </div> </details> <details> <p><summary> The reds cannot be that bright! </summary></p> <p><span class=tokipona>loje o suno ale ala</span> / “The reds must not be completely bright”</p> <p><span class=tokipona>loje o suno wawa ala</span> / “The reds must not be intensely bright”</p> <p><span class=tokipona>loje o suno pi wawa ala</span> / “The reds must be bright in a non-intense way”</p> <div class=info> <p>There’s a few interpretations possible here- if you caught <strong>loje</strong> as the subject taking an instruction, and brightness as <strong>suno</strong>, you’re set!</p> <p>Also, you can’t directly translate “that” as “ni”! Here, “that” is intensifying a statement as in a comparison.</p> </div> </details> <details> <p><summary> <strong>You must learn Toki Pona!</strong> </summary></p> <p><span class=tokipona>o kama sona e toki pona</span> / “Learn Toki Pona”</p> <p><span class=tokipona>sina o kama sona e toki pona</span> / “You must learn Toki Pona”</p> <p><span class=tokipona>sona sina pi toki pona o kama suli</span> / “Your knowledge of Toki Pona must grow”</p> </details> <details> <p><summary> Take this with you. </summary></p> <p><span class=tokipona>o jo e ni</span></p> </details> <details> <p><summary> Smash this pumpkin! </summary></p> <p><span class=tokipona>o pakala e kili suli ni</span></p> <p><span class=tokipona>o moli e kili loje ni</span></p> <p><span class=tokipona>o moli e kili jelo ni</span></p> </details> <details> <p><summary> Move the box out of the way! </summary></p> <p><span class=tokipona>o tawa e poki</span></p> <p><span class=tokipona>o weka e poki</span></p> </details> <details> <p><summary> Only remove the important files! </summary></p> <p><span class=tokipona>o weka e lipu suli taso</span></p> <p><span class=tokipona>o kama jo e lipu suli taso</span></p> <div class=info> <p>“Remove” in the sense of removing files (such as physically) is to convey instructions for which files to <em>take</em>. Thus, <strong>kama jo</strong>. But if it means “remove” as in “get rid of,” <strong>weka</strong>!</p> </div> </details> <h2 id=takeaway>Takeaway</h2> <h4 id=giving-instructions>Giving Instructions</h4> <p>Toki Pona is <em>earnest</em> by default. Giving somebody an instruction is not rude unless you are <em>very</em> intentional about being rude. You can tell somebody what to do, and it’s perfectly okay for them to say “mi ken ala” -&gt; “I am unable to.”</p> <h4 id=grammar>Grammar</h4> <p>You can optionally include <code>taso</code> before a sentence, which connects it to previous statements in a similar way to “but” or “however” in English.</p> <blockquote> <p>(taso) [subject] (li) [predicate] (e [object])</p> </blockquote> <p>taso can be used at the end of a phrase to indicate that particular phrase is exclusive.</p> <p>There’s also a bit more freedom for what can go <em>around</em> a sentence. You can interject subjects, followed by o, to indicate who should be listening!</p> <hr> <p><a href=./preps.html>Previous lesson</a></p> <p><a href=./interjections.html>Next lesson</a></p> </article> <footer> <p>Licensed under <a href=/LICENSE.txt>GPLv3</a>.</p> <p> Code on <a href=https://github.com/gregdan3/gregdan3.github.io>my GitHub</a>. </p> </footer> <script src=/toki-pona/sptoggle.js></script> <script data-goatcounter=https://gregdan3.goatcounter.com/count async src=//gc.zgo.at/count.js></script> </body> </html>
