I separated them to make them easier to remember.</p> <h2 id=overview>Overview</h2> <h4 id=instructions>Instructions</h4> <p>We’re going to look at another new sentence! We’ll use the particle <code>o</code>, so we can give instructions or set out requirements.</p> <p>The particle <code>o</code> is like <code>li</code>. It takes the same place in the sentence, but it changes the meaning: now, the sentence is an instruction!</p> <p>You may give instructions without a subject, which are directed at the listener:</p> <details> <p><summary>o lukin e kulupu kasi</summary></p> <p>Look at the forest.</p> <p>Look at the garden.</p> </details> <p>This is the most common form of an instruction, <em>without</em> a subject.</p> <div class=info> <p>In Toki Pona, it is not rude to give an instruction. If you say “o ni” as in “Do this”, it is as polite as “Can you please do this?” in English. There is no “please” in Toki Pona, and no need for it!</p> </div> <p>You may also give instructions to a specific subject:</p> <details> <p><summary> jan lili o musi nasa ala </summary></p> <p><strong>If jan lili is listening</strong>: Child, stop being silly!</p> <p><strong>If jan lili is not listening</strong>: The child has to stop being silly.</p> </details> <p>If the subject is not listening or not able to listen, you would interpret the statement as a requirement instead of a given instruction.</p> <details> <p><summary> lipu o pakala ala </summary></p> <p>The paper must not be torn.</p> <p>The documents must not be shredded.</p> </details> <p>This also applies to inanimate things! What does it mean to give instructions or apply requirements to a building, collection, light, or colors?</p> <p>You can also reword these as instructions:</p> <details> <p><summary> o pakala ala e lipu </summary></p> <p>Do not tear the paper.</p> <p>Do not shred the documents.</p> </details> <p>Now the listener is responsible for the paper!</p> <details> <p><summary> A note about politeness </summary></p> <p>It is possible to be rude in Toki Pona, as it is possible in any language. But in English, we soften requests with lots of extra words, such as please and can. In Toki Pona, there is an assumption that you are being earnest and respectful of your listener, so a request doesn’t need to be softened with other words. This is often called a “polite default” assumption, but I call it an “earnest default.”</p> </details> <h4 id=attention>Attention</h4> <p>You may use <code>o</code> directly after a subject phrase to get that subject’s attention:</p> <details> <p><summary> mama o! </summary></p> <p>Mom! [mom looks over]</p> <p>Dad! [dad looks over]</p> </details> <div class=info> <p>This is an interjection, which we’ll learn more about in the next lesson!</p> </div> <p>This may appear before or after a sentence, but both mean the same:</p> <details> <p><summary> jan sona o, sina pona! </summary></p> <p>Teacher, you’re excellent!</p> </details> <details> <p><summary> sina pona, jan sona o! </summary></p> <p>You’re excellent, teacher!</p> </details> <p>Here, <code>jan sona o</code> is getting the attention of <code>jan sona</code>, and then the speaker says a complete sentence directed at them. The order of these doesn’t matter, so do what feels right in the moment!</p> <p>You can use this interjection with an instruction, so you know that an instruction will be heard by its intended listener:</p> <details> <p><summary> jan ale o, o pana e lipu sina! </summary></p> <p>Everyone, please turn in your papers!</p> </details> <p>And you can put the two together, because an instruction with a subject can get the attention of that subject at the same time as instructing or requiring:</p> <details> <p><summary> jan ale o pana e lipu sina! </summary></p> <p>Everyone, please turn in your papers!</p> <p>Everyone must turn in their papers.</p> </details> <h4 id=taso-for-sentences>taso for sentences</h4> <p>Sometimes you’ll see <code>taso</code> at the start of a sentence. This is like saying “but” or “however,” and is usually used before a <em>later</em> sentence to connect two ideas.</p> <details> <p><summary> mi kute e pakala. taso mi pona. </summary></p> <p>I heard something break. But I’m alright!</p> </details> <p>The first sentence establishes context, and the second provides some clarifying or contrary information.</p> <p>For comparison, here is the second sentence without <code>taso</code>:</p> <blockquote> <p>mi kute e pakala. mi pona.</p> </blockquote> <p>Without <code>taso</code>, the sentences are not as clearly related.</p> <h4 id=taso-modifier>taso modifier</h4> <p><code>taso</code> is a modifier the rest of the time, but only as the <em>last</em> modifier of a phrase, affecting the entire phrase. Consider these examples:</p> <details> <p><summary> kute <strong>taso</strong> li pona e sona sina. </summary></p> <p>(Only listening) can improve your understanding.</p> </details> <details> <p><summary> kute li pona <strong>taso</strong> e sona sina. </summary></p> <p>Listening will (only improve) your understanding.</p> </details> <details> <p><summary> kute li pona e sona sina <strong>taso</strong>. </summary></p> <p>Listening will improve (your understanding only).</p> </details> <p>taso can also be the head of a phrase:</p> <details> <p><summary> taso li pona. </summary></p> <p>Being alone is good.</p> <p>Exclusivity is good.</p> </details> <div class=info> <p>If taso appears at the start of the sentence and is modified, things can get confusing! Try asking the speaker to restate themselves.</p> </div> <p>Otherwise, taso is rarely used as a normal modifier.</p> <h2 id=exercises>Exercises</h2> <div class=info> <p>In previous lessons, I gave many possible interpretations for each sentence. As these sentences get longer and more complex, I provide fewer or no interpretations other than the original.</p> </div> <h3 id=toki-pona-to-english>Toki Pona to English</h3> <h4 id=o-for-commands>o for commands</h4> <details> <p><summary> o utala ala e soweli! </summary> Don’t attack the bears!</p> </details> <p>You’re on a boat with some friends, enjoying the sun and the wind. One of your friends has been intently watching over the side, waiting for… Something? Eventually, they call out to everyone to come look, because they spotted something! They say:</p> <details> <p><summary> o lukin e kala suli! </summary></p> <p>Look at this huuuuge fish!</p> </details> <details> <p><summary> </summary></p> </details> <details> <p><summary> </summary></p> </details> <details> <p><summary> </summary></p> </details> <details> <p><summary> </summary></p> </details> <h4 id=o-with-a-subject>o with a subject</h4> <p>Your dad is leaving you at home while he runs errands. He wants you to clean the house, because you made a mess of the place not long ago, bringing in a bunch of branches from outside. He says to you:</p> <details> <p><summary> palisa o jaki ala e tomo. o weka e palisa! </summary></p> <p>Sticks must not make the house gross. Remove the sticks!</p> </details> <p>You’ve been hanging out on the porch for too long, and you’ve started to notice lots of obnoxious bugs coming out as the sun sets. In your frustration, you yell out at the bugs:</p> <details> <p><summary> pipi o weka! </summary></p> <p>Bugs, go away!</p> <p>Bugs have to go away!</p> </details> <details> <p><summary> jan sona o pana e sona </summary></p> <p>The person who knows has to explain!</p> </details> <p>You’re explaining the rules to the game: When the leader covers their eyes, everyone runs as fast as they can. When the leader opens their eyes, if anyone is seen moving they’re out! You explain:</p> <details> <p><summary> ona ale o tawa ala! </summary></p> <p>They all must not move!</p> </details> <h4 id=o-for-attention>o for attention</h4> <p>You spotted a cute lizard, and you’re trying to get its attention!</p> <details> <p><summary> akesi o! </summary></p> <p>Hey, frog!</p> <p>Hey, lizard!</p> </details> <p>You brought your friend out to birdwatch with you. They are much newer to the hobby than you, and keep scaring off birds with their calls:</p> <details> <p><summary> waso o! </summary></p> <p>Hey, bird!</p> </details> <h4 id=sentence-start-taso>Sentence-start taso</h4> <p>You’re discussing hobbies with a friend, especially when you like to work on your hobbies. Your friend is a morning person and loves feeling the sun as they’re productive. You like the sun, but prefer to work in the dark when the moon is out. You tell them:</p> <details> <p><summary> suno li pona. taso pimeja li pona e pali mi. </summary></p> <p>The sun is good, but darkness helps me work.</p> <hr> <ul> <li>Sunlight is okay, but the shade improves my productivity.</li> <li>Lights are wonderful, but I prefer no lights for my hobbies.</li> </ul> </details> <p>It’s the middle of winter, and you’ve seen nothing but dreary gray skies for weeks. One day, the cloud cover finally breaks, opening up to reveal beautiful sunlight! You step outside to bask, but unfortunately, the air is still frigid around you. You remark to yourself:</p> <details> <p><summary> mi pilin e suno. taso mi lete. </summary></p> <p>I feel the sunlight, but I feel cold.</p> </details> <details> <p><summary> mi waso ala, taso mi ken tawa sewi </summary></p> <p>I am not a bird, but I can fly</p> </details> <h4 id=modifier-taso>Modifier taso</h4> <p>Your friend has become quite philosophical as of late, and has been throwing various statements in their new philosophical views your way for review. The most recent one seems rather obvious to you, but you don’t let them know that. The statement:</p> <details> <p><summary> <strong>ala li pona taso.</strong> </summary></p> <p>Nothing is exclusively good.</p> <p>Nothingness is only good!</p> <div class=info> <p>This statement has two possible interpretations, even in the given context! It could be saying that <em>no object exists which is entirely good</em>, or <em>nothingness itself is exclusively good</em>. Maybe your friend is wiser than you thought?</p> </div> </details> <p>Your friend is down-trodden, feeling rejected. They haven’t been invited to any parties or events lately, and are worried that all their friends are abandoning them. As a way of lashing out, they insist their friends are the problem, but you console them with some helpful perspective:</p> <details> <p><summary> jan pona sina li ike ala! ona li pali taso. ona li wile e sina </summary></p> <p>Your friends are not mean! They’re only working. They want you.</p> </details> <h3 id=english-to-toki-pona>English to Toki Pona</h3> <details> <p><summary> I want the shiny black rock! </summary></p> <p>mi wile e kiwen pimeja suno!</p> <p>mi wile e kiwen pimeja pona!</p> </details> <details> <p><summary> They only have their id card. </summary></p> <p>ona li jo taso e lipu ona.</p> <p>ona li jo taso e lipu jan ona.</p> </details> <h2 id=takeaway>Takeaway</h2> <h4 id=giving-instructions>Giving Instructions</h4> <p>Toki Pona is <em>earnest</em> by default</p> <h4 id=grammar>Grammar</h4> <p>You can optionally include <code>taso</code> before a sentence, which connects it to previous statements in a similar way to “but” or “however” in English.</p> <blockquote> <p>(taso) [subject] (li) [predicate] (e [object])</p> </blockquote> <p>taso can be used at the end of a phrase to indicate that particular phrase is exclusive.</p> <hr> <p><a href=./pre-predicates.html>Previous lesson</a></p> <p><a href=./preps.html>Next lesson</a></p> </article> <footer> <p>Licensed under <a href=/LICENSE.txt>GPLv3</a>.</p> <p> Code on <a href=https://github.com/gregdan3/gregdan3.github.io>my GitHub</a>. </p> </footer> <script data-goatcounter=https://gregdan3.goatcounter.com/count async src=//gc.zgo.at/count.js></script> </body> </html>
