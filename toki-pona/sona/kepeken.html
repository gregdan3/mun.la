But some people are bringing back <code>kepeken e</code> for transitive prepositions, which is fun.</p> <details> <p><summary> Note </summary></p> <p>In the History section, I give a brief overview of the historical use of kepeken. My involvement with the Toki Pona community only began in July of 2021, so I was not present for any historical practices of Toki Pona. However, I have seen old lessons and documentation, particularly jan Pije’s course, from prior to pu. As such, I provide everything I know to be true as of today.</p> <p>If you’d like to see how kepeken was taught as far back as 2006, check <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017110330/http://bknight0.myweb.uga.edu/toki/lesson/lesson6.html>here</a>!</p> </details> <h2 id=history>History</h2> <p>Prior to Toki Pona: The Language of Good (pu), kepeken had a split history. The word saw many distinct uses, both as a preposition and as a transitive verb. These two uses appeared at different times and in different lessons, but the commonality was that they were both used to mean <code>to use</code>. In other words, the proper use of <code>kepeken</code> was <em>both</em> as a transitive verb and a preposition at various times, but they had the same meaning: <code>using.</code></p> <p>Since pu, kepeken has been taught as an exclusive preposition, never being a transitive verb and rarely being used without an object as <code>mi kepeken</code>. pu replaced all the previous ways kepeken was used with exactly one use with one meaning: a preposition meaning <code>using</code>.</p> <p>Modern use of kepeken has seen a small return to <code>kepeken e</code> in the form of transitive prepositions, but these are rare.</p> <h2 id=proper-use>Proper use</h2> <p>The recommended use today is to say <code>mi kepeken ilo</code>, or <code>mi pali e tomo kepeken ilo</code>. <code>kepeken</code>, being a preposition, can appear in a <code>la</code> clause as well. <code>kepeken e</code> is considered an error in all cases, and if it were interpreted with a modern view of Toki Pona, it would read something like <code>applying using to</code> in the same way other transitive verbs do.</p> <p>As a reference on usage: in a (flimsy) comparison to English, consider the word <code>using</code>: <code>I built a house using tools</code>. <code>Using</code> is not analyzed as a preposition in English, but it serves a similar function of providing secondary information about an action.</p> <h2 id=other-notes>Other Notes</h2> <p>There is some fringe use of <code>kepeken e</code> in the form of transitive prepositions!</p> <p>Consider: <code>mi kepeken ilo e sina</code>. The core of the sentence is <code>mi kepeken e sina</code>, which would mean <code>I apply using to you</code>. The original has <code>kepeken ilo</code>, <code>using tools</code>. If this is considered, the sentence now reads <code>I apply tool-using to you.</code> In other words, this is a concise way to say <code>I make you use tools.</code></p> <hr> <p><a href=/toki-pona/ >Back home</a></p> </article> <footer> <p>Licensed under <a href=/LICENSE.txt>GPLv3</a>.</p> <p> Code on <a href=https://github.com/gregdan3/gregdan3.github.io>my GitHub</a>. </p> </footer> <script src=/toki-pona/sptoggle.js></script> <script data-goatcounter=https://gregdan3.goatcounter.com/count async src=//gc.zgo.at/count.js></script> </body> </html>
