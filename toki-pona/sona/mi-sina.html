I, me, my, mine, we, our, myself, ourselves</li> <li><code>sina</code> - Second person pronoun. You, yours, yourself, y’all, y’all’s</li> </ul> <p>This means English interpretations looks something like this:</p> <blockquote> <p>I am [predicate]</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>We are [predicate]</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>You are [predicate]</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Y’all are [predicate]</p> </blockquote> <p>And sentences always look like this:</p> <blockquote> <p><code>[mi/sina] [predicate]</code></p> </blockquote> <p>The predicate is always able to be a verb, adjective, or both. Any verb/adjective may be used to describe the speaker or listener, and talk about what the speaker or listener does.</p> <h2 id=exercises>Exercises</h2> <div class=info> <p>Translation is inexact!

This is intended! And it comes from two different effects:</p> <h4 id=verbadjective-duality>Verb/Adjective duality</h4> <p>As noted before, predicates in Toki Pona words may be verbs, adjectives, or both! If something is an action, it is also a description. In English, you might say that if a person walks, they are also a walking person. Toki Pona runs with this idea. There is no difference between “doing” and “being” expressed by the words or grammar.</p> <details> <p><summary> A note on “verb” and “adjective” </summary></p> <p>Though I do use “verb” and “adjective” to describe the properties of the sentence, they are not a great fit for what Toki Pona’s words do. In the community, <em>predicate</em> is preferred over verb, and <em>adjective</em> is rarely used in analyzing the predicate.</p> </details> <h4 id=broadness>Broadness</h4> <p>Toki Pona words have broad meanings. <code>mi</code> doesn’t refer to just yourself like “I” does. It can also refer to a group of people including yourself like “we”, an action taken on yourself like “myself”, and something that belongs to you such as “mine” or “my”; all of these depend on context and place in a sentence. <code>sina</code> works the same way, and so do <em>all</em> Toki Pona words.</p> <p>Words do not mark plurality or tense either! <code>jan</code> may talk about one person, four people, an entire population of people, and anything between. <code>moku</code> may talk about eating right now, eating in the near future, drinking in the distant past, becoming edible exactly a week from now, and more.</p> <p>This is a lot, but the broadness is part of the strength of Toki Pona. And, it is easier to navigate than you think! Context is everything, and understanding a sentence is much easier when you’re seeing what it describes.</p> <p>That said, a helpful strategy for understanding a sentence with less context is to consider how reasonable it is. For example, <code>mi moku</code> is able to mean “we are food”, but it is more likely that <code>mi</code> is just the speaker, and <code>moku</code> is “eat”. You can use this thinking to reason about sentences in the future.</p> <h2 id=other-notes>Other Notes</h2> <p>As in one of the examples, which is <em>not</em> a sentence, you can say <code>toki</code> on its own to mean “hello!”</p> <hr> <p><a href=./open.html>Previous lesson</a></p> <p><a href=./li.html>Next lesson</a></p> </article> <footer> <p>Licensed under <a href=/LICENSE.txt>GPLv3</a>.</p> <p> Code on <a href=https://github.com/gregdan3/gregdan3.github.io>my GitHub</a>. </p> </footer> <script data-goatcounter=https://gregdan3.goatcounter.com/count async src=//gc.zgo.at/count.js></script> </body> </html>
