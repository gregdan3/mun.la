    <article><p>This is an adaptation of a short lesson I gave in the kama sona server.</p>

<p>The opening to Conlang Critic is short, punchy, and comedic. Can we replicate
that in Toki Pona? Absolutely.</p>

<p>First, the original text:</p>

<blockquote><p>Welcome to Conlang Critic, the show that gets facts wrong about <em>your</em>
favorite conlang!</p></blockquote>

<p>And this is followed by jan Misali&rsquo;s self introduction.</p>

<a name="Specific-translations"></a>
<h2>Specific translations</h2>

<a name="Welcome"></a>
<h4>Welcome</h4>

<p>Welcomes are simple! They are usually expressed as an instruction using &ldquo;o&rdquo;,
and ended with &ldquo;pona&rdquo; to express the well-wishing nature of the instruction.
Otherwise, a welcome is a kind of arrival, so we can use &ldquo;kama&rdquo;: &ldquo;o kama pona&rdquo;</p>

<p>You can also use the preposition &ldquo;tawa&rdquo; to express where you&rsquo;re welcoming
somebody to, so &ldquo;o kama pona tawa &hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<a name="Conlang-Critic"></a>
<h4>Conlang Critic</h4>

<p>Conlang Critic could be a proper noun with a capital letter name, or you could
translate it. In either case, jan Misali says it&rsquo;s a show, and a show is
entertainment, which is musi. If you use a proper noun, your job is done here:
&ldquo;musi Conlang Critic&rdquo;, or whatever adaptation you prefer. You can do a little
better when you zoom in on &ldquo;Conlang Critic&rdquo; though!</p>

<a name="Conlangs"></a>
<h4>Conlangs</h4>

<p>Conlang, short for constructed language, could be described as both a pali
(creation) and as a toki (language). This is an important decision when
deciding translations: which one is more important, and becomes the head noun?
Here, we&rsquo;ll say that a constructed language is a &ldquo;language&rdquo; before it is
&ldquo;constructed&rdquo;. But since both work, we can call it a &ldquo;toki pali.&rdquo;</p>

<a name="Critics"></a>
<h4>Critics</h4>

<p>As for critic, we don&rsquo;t need to translate it as a single phrase; critics do one
thing: talk about a subject. Let&rsquo;s make that a separate sentence! Our speaker
will call themselves &ldquo;mi&rdquo;, and will &ldquo;toki&rdquo;. It is relatively common to say you
talk &ldquo;about&rdquo; something as &ldquo;jan li toki <strong>lon</strong> ijo&rdquo;, so we&rsquo;ll reuse that here,
but be aware that there are more ways to translate this too.</p>

<a name="Favorites"></a>
<h4>Favorites</h4>

<p>When describing their preferences, most people refer to things being &ldquo;pona tawa
mi&rdquo;, good to them. A favorite is something that is the most good, or you might
say first place in goodness! We can say that this is &ldquo;nanpa wan&rdquo;, which can
apply to any property: &ldquo;ni li pona nanpa wan tawa mi&rdquo;. So now we know our
critic will talk about &ldquo;toki pali sina nanpa wan&rdquo;, your favorite conlang!</p>

<a name="Facts-2c--Wrongness"></a>
<h4>Facts, Wrongness</h4>

<p>Facts and wrongness often have to do with &ldquo;lon&rdquo; and &ldquo;lon ala&rdquo; respectively.
&ldquo;lon&rdquo; deals with truth, so we could have our critic will speak in an untruthful
way: &ldquo;toki pi lon ala&rdquo;. Let&rsquo;s try it!</p>

<a name="Putting-it-together"></a>
<h2>Putting it together</h2>

<a name="Attempt--23-1"></a>
<h4>Attempt #1</h4>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the two halves of the opener we&rsquo;ve made so far. Translations are under
the spoilers.</p>

<p><details> <summary> o kama pona tawa musi mi! mi toki lon toki pali. </summary>
Welcome to my entertainment! I talk about created languages. </details></p>

<p><details> <summary> toki sina nanpa wan la musi ni li toki pi lon ala!
</summary> In the context of your favorite language, this entertainment tells
lies! </details></p>

<p>Looking good so far! You&rsquo;ll notice that in the second sentence, we refer to
only &ldquo;toki sina nanpa wan&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;toki pali sina nanpa wan&rdquo;. This is
because we&rsquo;ve already introduced the fact that the critic is going to talk
about &ldquo;toki pali&rdquo;. From there, the only kind of &ldquo;toki&rdquo; that would be reasonable
to mean would be other &ldquo;toki pali.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Except there&rsquo;s still one problem: that&rsquo;s not quite the original meaning! &ldquo;toki
pi lon ala&rdquo; definitely captures the idea of <em>lying</em>, but the statement actually
says they&rsquo;re getting facts <em>wrong</em>, jokingly, about your favorite conlang.
We&rsquo;ve translated the idea of being wrong correctly; in the process, we&rsquo;ve
translated it too literally. The intended meaning is about making mistakes,
which is more like &ldquo;pakala&rdquo;! Let&rsquo;s try again:</p>

<a name="Attempt--23-2"></a>
<h4>Attempt #2</h4>

<p>The first half was already great, so here&rsquo;s the edited second half:</p>

<p><details> <summary> toki sina nanpa wan la, musi ni li toki pakala! </summary>
In the context of your favorite language, this entertainment speaks mistakenly!
</details></p>

<a name="Conclusion"></a>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The process of translation, especially into Toki Pona, can never be one-to-one.
You make compromises, subtle changes, artistic and informational decisions,
throughout the entire dialog. The skills that will help you most are
recognizing the objects and actions of a sentence, and breaking those down
individually without the rest of the sentence. This will get faster over time
too, until you&rsquo;re no longer thinking about it!</p>

<hr />

<p>Also, I recorded the final result. Enjoy!</p>
