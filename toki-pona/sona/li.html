Any word but <code>mi</code> and <code>sina</code> can be in the subject while <code>li</code> is present, and any word can be in the predicate! Anything is possible! We&rsquo;re still limited to either basic action or description, but you&rsquo;ll find that the variety in Toki Pona words lets you say a lot.</p> <p><details> <summary> A note on &ldquo;any word&rdquo; </summary></p> <p>I do say &ldquo;any word&rdquo;, but clever observers will have noticed I am treating the word <code>li</code> differently. Its definition is given in parentheses, and it is treated as a grammatical structure instead of as a word. This is because <code>li</code> cannot be used in the subject or predicate, with some subtle exceptions we&rsquo;ll get to later. For now, everything <em>else</em> can be in the subject or predicate.</p> <p></details></p> <p>Since a word may be in the subject, all the words in the predicate before can now be used as subjects and reference objects or actions instead of being an action! This leans even more heavily into the verb/adjective duality described before. Unlike that duality, you can tell which sense a word is meant in based on its place in a sentence. Subjects are more likely to be specific objects or ideas, where predicates are more likely to be actions or descriptions!</p> <div class=warning><p>Remember, if the subject is <em>just</em> mi or <em>just</em> sina, do not include <code>li</code>!</p></div> <a name=Exercises></a> <h2>Exercises</h2> <a name=Toki-Pona-to-English></a> <h3>Toki Pona to English</h3> <p>You and a friend are looking through old photos. Your friend points to one of a person leaning against a wall, smiling wide at the camera and says:</p> <p><details> <summary> jan li mi! </summary></p> <p>The person is me!</p> <hr> <ul> <li>The person belongs to me.</li> <li>The person is related to me. (not in the family sense)</li> </ul> <p></details></p> <p>A group of friends is at the side of a pool. All of them stare into the water, unsure whether they are ready to brave it. Suddenly, one friend cannonballs into the water, splashing everyone. When they surface, they yell:</p> <p><details> <summary> telo li lete! </summary></p> <p>The water is cold!</p> <hr> <ul> <li>The water is icy.</li> <li>The water is not boiling.</li> <li>The pool is freezing.</li> <li>The soda is cool!</li> <li>The ocean is cold.</li> </ul> <p></details></p> <p>You are walking along a forest trail, and brush your hand over a rock. When you pull your hand away, you find it covered in tree sap and remark:</p> <p><details> <summary> kiwen li ko&hellip; </summary></p> <p>The rock is gooey&hellip;</p> <hr> <ul> <li>The rock is dusty</li> <li>The rock is sticky</li> <li>The metal is glued</li> <li>The rock</li> </ul> <p></details></p> <p>You&rsquo;re on an expedition to see the tallest tree in the world. You&rsquo;ve walked for hours upon hours, sweating heavily under the sun. You hike to the peak of one more hill, and spot the tree on the horizon. You can see it from miles away! You shout:</p> <p><details> <summary> kasi li suli </summary></p> <p>The tree is <em>enormous!</em></p> <hr> <ul> <li>The vine is long.</li> <li>The tree trunk is so wide.</li> <li>The patch of moss is huge!</li> <li>Plants are important.</li> <li>The grass has grown tall.</li> </ul> <p></details></p> <p>On an epic quest, you stop at a wizard&rsquo;s tower and climb it. At the top, the wizard is deep in research. He teaches you a new spell to aid your journey: Spoonform. With this power, you can turn into a spoon for a short time. You don&rsquo;t tell the wizard, but you think to yourself:</p> <p><details> <summary> wawa li nasa! </summary></p> <p>Magic is ridiculous!</p> <hr> <ul> <li>Power is absurd.</li> <li>Strength is odd.</li> <li>Confidence is confusing.</li> </ul> <p></details></p> <p>While visiting your grandmother&rsquo;s house, she offers you piles of different sweets! You try each and every one, enjoying the smell and taste of your grandmother&rsquo;s wonderful cooking. Your most favorite was her apple pie- thinking about it again, you think to yourself:</p> <p><details> <summary> moku li suwi </summary></p> <p>Pie is sweet!</p> <hr> <ul> <li>The food is sweet</li> <li>The water is sugary</li> <li>The food is cute</li> </ul> <p></details></p> <p>After enjoying your grandmother&rsquo;s cooking, you and your family head out to the beach to swim! The sun is beaming brightly, and the air feels hot as the ocean breeze whips past. You take your first step out on the sand and recoil- it&rsquo;s way too hot!</p> <p><details> <summary> ko li seli! </summary></p> <p>The sand is hot!</p> <hr> <ul> <li>The tar is on fire!</li> <li>The dough is warming.</li> <li>The glue is melty! (due to temperature)</li> </ul> <p></details></p> <p>You&rsquo;ve just come home from a long vacation. Unwinding was wonderful, but being back home means being back to the grind! While settling back in, you open your fridge and to your dismay discover some of your food went bad while you were gone! You shout:</p> <p><details> <summary> moku li jaki! </summary></p> <p>The food&rsquo;s gone bad!</p> <hr> <ul> <li>The pasta is moldy&hellip;</li> <li>The chips are stale!</li> <li>The pie tastes awful.</li> <li>Eating is gross!</li> </ul> <p></details></p> <a name=English-to-Toki-Pona></a> <h3>English to Toki Pona</h3> <div class=info><p>Some of these will have a few translations under the spoiler!</p></div> <p><details> <summary> The sand is sludgy. </summary></p> <p>ko li jaki</p> <p></details></p> <p><details> <summary> I&rsquo;m warm </summary></p> <p>mi seli</p> <p></details></p> <p><details> <summary> The conversation is weird! </summary></p> <p>toki li nasa!</p> <p></details></p> <p><details> <summary> The cold is unpleasant. </summary></p> <p>lete li ike</p> <p></details></p> <p><details> <summary> The plant is cute! </summary></p> <p>kasi li suwi!</p> <p>kasi li pona!</p> <p></details></p> <p><details> <summary> You&rsquo;re magical! </summary></p> <p>sina pona</p> <p>sina wawa</p> <p>sina nasa</p> <p></details></p> <p><details> <summary> The community is friendly. </summary></p> <p>kulupu li pona</p> <p></details></p> <p><details> <summary> The water is fast! </summary></p> <p>telo li wawa!</p> <p></details></p> <p><details> <summary> Strangeness is wonderful </summary></p> <p>nasa li pona</p> <p></details></p> <p><details> <summary> People are strong </summary></p> <p>jan li wawa</p> <p></details></p> <p><details> <summary> The gravel is muddy </summary></p> <p>ko li jaki</p> <p>kiwen li jaki</p> <p></details></p> <a name=Takeaway></a> <h2>Takeaway</h2> <a name=Grammar></a> <h4>Grammar</h4> <p>In the previous lesson, we covered a sentence which exclusively began with either <code>mi</code> or <code>sina</code>. In this lesson, we covered a sentence where anything can start the sentence- so long as it is followed by <code>li</code>. In fact, these are the same kind of sentence!</p> <blockquote><p><code>[mi/sina] [predicate]</code></p> <p><code>[subject] li [predicate]</code></p></blockquote> <p>Another way to think about this sentence is this: if the subject is <em>exactly</em> mi or <em>exactly</em> sina, don&rsquo;t include <code>li</code>.</p> <a name=Content-Words-and-Particles></a> <h4>Content Words and Particles</h4> <p>As in many examples, any <em>meaningful</em> word may appear in either the subject <em>or</em> the predicate, or even in both at once. When I say &ldquo;meaningful&rdquo;, this refers the idea of a <strong>content word</strong>, or a word which serves some <em>semantic</em> function instead of an exclusively grammatical one. The word <code>li</code> is only grammatical- it is not a content word. Every other word so far is a content word.</p> <p>The word <code>li</code> is a <strong>particle</strong>, and is not the only one! We will learn about the rest in future lessons. What they have in common is having no semantic function- no meaning.</p> <p>There are also a handful of words which are so-called <strong>pseudo-particles</strong>. This category is more blurry, but it contains words which have functions as particles <em>and</em> as content words.</p> <hr> <p><a href=./mi-sina.html>Previous lesson</a></p> </article> <footer> <p>Licensed under <a href=/LICENSE.txt>GPLv3</a>.</p> <p> Code on <a href=https://github.com/gregdan3/gregdan3.github.io>my GitHub</a>. </p> </footer> </body> </html>
