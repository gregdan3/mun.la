<h4>Summary</h4>

<p><code>pali</code> doesn&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;do&rdquo;, just &ldquo;work&rdquo; or &ldquo;create&rdquo;.</p>

<a name="palin-27-t"></a>
<h2>palin&rsquo;t</h2>

<p>This small nasin is interesting enough to document because it changes an
existing word, rather than outright adding or removing words or grammatical
behaviors.</p>

<p>palin&rsquo;t is named weirdly. Unlike other <code>n't</code> nasin, this one does use pali. But
it doesn&rsquo;t use one meaning of pali: &ldquo;to do&rdquo;. This way, pali only means to
create or to work, <a href="https://lipu-linku.github.io/?q=pali">among a few other related
definitions</a>. Keep in mind, it can still
mean any kind of creating or working, which overlap with &ldquo;do&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This distinction is sometimes subtle. Both working and creating are kinds of
doing, but &ldquo;to do&rdquo; is more broad than both. You can think of this removing
pali&rsquo;s most generic meaning. The primary consequence of this is changing a
common conversation starter:</p>

<blockquote><p>sina pali e seme?</p></blockquote>

<p>This is taught as a greeting to learners, to mean &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;. It
works given pali&rsquo;s &ldquo;do&rdquo; meaning, but without that meaning, this statement is
more like &ldquo;What are you working on?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What are you creating?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Still, remember that &ldquo;to do&rdquo; is a pu usage of the word pali, and will be
understood by most Toki Pona speakers. But the use of pali as &ldquo;to do&rdquo; is
falling out of popularity over time, even with pu using &ldquo;sina pali e seme&rdquo; as
an example greeting.</p>

<p>On that note, I recommend these conversation starters instead:</p>

<blockquote><p>sina seme?</p></blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; in Toki Pona&rsquo;s most common nasin. Could also be &ldquo;What
describes you?&rdquo;, or &ldquo;What kind of &lsquo;you&rsquo; are you?&rdquo; if taken literally. For
comparison, &ldquo;jan seme&rdquo; asks the same questions: &ldquo;What describes this person?&rdquo;
or &ldquo;What kind of person?&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote><p>seme li lon?</p></blockquote>

<p>Literally, &ldquo;What exists?&rdquo;. Figuratively, &ldquo;What is happening?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;.
This is also my personal favorite.</p>

<blockquote><p>seme li sin?</p></blockquote>

<p>Similarly to &ldquo;seme li lon&rdquo;, this asks what is <em>new</em> rather than what <em>exists</em>.</p>

<p>I encourage you to be as curious as you want as well, and use any conversation
starter! Ask about somebody&rsquo;s week, or their favorite hobby. Ask about a trip
they want to go on. There are interesting topics in every direction; be
excited!</p>
