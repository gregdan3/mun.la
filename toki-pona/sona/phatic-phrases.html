        <p>There is a <em>lot</em> of discourse about phatic phrases in Toki Pona. A phatic
phrase is a short and polite turn of phrase which doesn&rsquo;t necessarily convey
meaning, or not deep meaning. Phatic phrases <em>do</em> exist in Toki Pona. However,
myself and others discourage their use, for good reason. Do you want to have
the following conversation?</p>

<blockquote><p>toki. sina seme?</p>

<blockquote><p>mi pona. sina seme?</p>

<blockquote><p>mi pona kin. [pini]</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>Not really. This doesn&rsquo;t convey anything about either speaker, and it doesn&rsquo;t
give you anything to think about.</p>

<p>If a friend asks you how your day went, do you say &ldquo;fine&rdquo; and leave it there?</p>

<p>If somebody teaches you a new skill, do you tell them only &ldquo;sina pona&rdquo; and end
it there?</p>

<p>Toki Pona places an emphasis on simplicity and breaking down your thoughts into
their important units. However, this does <em>not</em> encourage over-simplifying to
the detriment of your conversations!</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re in a conversation, think more deeply about what things you&rsquo;ve been
doing, especially that your listener cares about. Answer earnestly and deeply
about how you feel, and what you appreciate in your friends, family, teachers,
and others. You should answer honestly to the questions &ldquo;sina seme?&rdquo; or &ldquo;seme
li lon?&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote><p>toki. sina seme?</p>

<blockquote><p>mi pona! tenpo pini la mi pali e lipu sona pi toki ilo</p>

<blockquote><p>wawa a! lipu la seme li lon?</p>

<blockquote><p>ilo li ken&hellip; [awen]</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>There is knowledge all around you. If you are excited to learn, you should ask
for the knowledge!</p>

<h2>Phrase thinking and context</h2>

<p>What follows is a sort of phrasebook, but suggesting <em>continuations</em> or
<em>replacements</em> for specific phrases that would otherwise be phatic.
Importantly, I provide context in alternative situations for many of these, as
they change depending on what is currently happening!</p>

<a name="sina-pona"></a>
<h3>sina pona</h3>

<p>&ldquo;sina pona&rdquo; is the common shorthand for &ldquo;thank you&rdquo;, or &ldquo;I appreciate you&rdquo;, all
in one. It literally means &ldquo;you are good.&rdquo; On its own, it is an appreciated
gesture, but how can you answer</p>

<a name="mi-tawa"></a>
<h3>mi tawa</h3>

<p>&ldquo;mi tawa&rdquo; is the common-use phrase for &ldquo;goodbye!&rdquo;, spoken by the person
leaving. Its literal interpretation is closer to &ldquo;I am leaving&rdquo;, or &ldquo;I am
moving&rdquo; which contextually is closer to leaving. What if the kind of leaving
you&rsquo;re doing isn&rsquo;t just about moving? It may be true that you move no matter
how you leave, but what about where you&rsquo;re going?</p>

<p>You may want to express specifically where you&rsquo;re going:</p>

<blockquote><p>mi tawa ma sin
mi tawa pali
mi tawa tomo pi wawa sijelo</p></blockquote>

<p>Or you can express what you&rsquo;re leaving to do:</p>

<blockquote><p>mi tawa la mi moku
mi o pali
mi wile</p></blockquote>

<p>Or talk about when you plan to come back:</p>

<blockquote><p>mi weka lili, mi kama sin</p>

<p>mi weka lili (which can imply a short-term return)</p>

<p>mi tawa. tenpo kulupu kama la mi kama</p></blockquote>

<a name="tawa-pona"></a>
<h3>tawa pona</h3>

<p>&ldquo;tawa pona&rdquo; is the common-use phrase for &ldquo;goodbye&rdquo;, spoken to the person who&rsquo;s
leaving.</p>
