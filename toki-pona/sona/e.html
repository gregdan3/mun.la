The subject can now act on other things, applying the predicate to something else, with the use of <code>e</code>!</p> <blockquote> <p>[mi/sina] [predicate] e [object]</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>[subject] li [predicate] e [object]</p> </blockquote> <p>This new phrase introduces a thing the subject acts on in a way that the predicate specifies.</p> <details> <p><summary>A note about “predicate”</summary></p> <p>I am using “predicate” to refer to <em>just</em> the position of the action/description of a phrase, excluding the object.</p> <p>In common grammatical terms, “predicate” refers to the entirety of the action/description and the object(s) it acts on. However, it can also refer to just the action/description clause, which is very convenient for these lessons!</p> </details> <h4 id=changing-things>Changing things</h4> <p>Here are a few guided examples of how the subject acts on the object, applying the predicate to it:</p> <details> <p><summary> mi pona e jan </summary></p> <ul> <li>I help somebody.</li> <li>I improve people.</li> <li>I heal people.</li> <li>I tend to people.</li> <li>I make people feel better.</li> </ul> </details> <p>The <code>jan</code> becomes <code>pona</code> in some way, as in the translations given.</p> <details> <p><summary> lape li wawa e sina </summary></p> <ul> <li>Sleep makes you stronger</li> <li>Rest makes you confident</li> <li>Napping makes you energetic</li> <li>Relaxing energizes you</li> <li>Vacation empowers you</li> </ul> </details> <p>Here, <code>sina</code> becomes <code>wawa</code> in some way.</p> <h4 id=not-changing-things>Not changing things</h4> <p>Not everything changes the object! Here are some examples, using two new words:</p> <details> <p><summary> jan li pilin e kiwen </summary></p> <ul> <li>The person feels a rock.</li> <li>Somebody touched metal.</li> <li>Everyone touched this stone.</li> <li>People have been feeling this rock.</li> </ul> </details> <p>Here, the <code>kiwen</code> is <em>felt</em> or <em>touched</em>, but it never is or becomes <code>pilin</code>. Instead, the subject is the only one that does any <code>pilin</code>.</p> <details> <p><summary> mi wile e telo </summary></p> <ul> <li>I want water</li> <li>I need water</li> <li>I need (liquid) fuel</li> <li>I am thirsty</li> </ul> </details> <p>Again, the <code>telo</code> is <em>wanted</em> or <em>needed</em>, but it does not become <code>wile</code> or do the action <code>wile</code> or become describable by <code>wile</code>. The subject <em>wants</em>, <em>needs</em>, <code>wile</code> the <code>telo</code>.</p> <p>As you study, you’ll get an intuitive sense for this difference. Some words will be actions the subject takes on an object, but which do not change that object. Other words will change the object in some way, usually applying a new property to the object.</p> <details> <p><summary> A note on “not” changing things </summary></p> <p>As you become more advanced in Toki Pona, you’ll learn that the above is somewhat disingenuous. It <em>is</em> possible to describe an object as a wanted object, and to apply want to that object. For the time being, this simplification will work.</p> <p>That said, the following is possible:</p> <blockquote> <p>mi wile e telo.</p> </blockquote> <p>“I want water.”</p> <blockquote> <p>telo wile li pona e mi.</p> </blockquote> <p>“The water I want will make me feel better.”</p> <p>This uses a modifier (next lesson!) to demonstrate the point, now referencing a “wanted liquid.”</p> </details> <h2 id=exercises>Exercises</h2> <h3 id=toki-pona-to-english>Toki Pona to English</h3> <p>A parent is doing his best to make his kid eat his dinner, resulting in an argument at the table. The kid offers the very reasonable point that vegetables are gross! But after some arguing back and forth, mom chimes in with convincing wisdom:</p> <details> <p><summary> moku li pona e sina </summary></p> <p>The food will make you feel better!</p> <hr> <ul> <li>Food makes you nicer</li> <li>Eating makes you friendlier</li> <li>Food heals you</li> <li>Food improves you</li> </ul> </details> <p>You’ve been struggling in class, trying your hardest to follow along with the lessons and lab. You hire a tutor to help, and they provide well-practiced teaching and piles of useful examples. Late one night, you are pouring over the textbook and you realize you actually understand every word. You exclaim:</p> <details> <p><summary> mi sona e lipu! </summary></p> <p>I understood the textbook!</p> <hr> </details> <p>Halloween night! A group of sheet-clad friends, dressed like classic ghosts, walk from home to home shouting “Trick or treat!” and get piles of sweets in hand at each door! At the end of the night, everyone compares their hauls. One friend pulls a weighty, dirty chunk from his bag and says…</p> <details> <p><summary> mi jo e kiwen… </summary></p> <p>I have a rock…</p> <hr> <ul> <li>I have metal.</li> <li>I own a pebble.</li> <li>I have a gem!</li> <li>I have gravel!</li> <li>I have a durable chunk.</li> <li>I got a brick.</li> </ul> </details> <p>You and your brother are up to no good, trying to play a prank the neighbor. You just finished setting up the sprinkler system to go off when your neighbor walks out, when your brother yells a warning out at you:</p> <details> <p><summary> mama li lukin e sina! </summary></p> <p>Mom sees you!</p> <hr> <ul> <li>Mom is looking at you</li> <li>Dad is looking at you</li> <li>The babysitter sees you!</li> <li>The parents are looking at you</li> <li>The nanny is staring at you</li> </ul> </details> <p>You’re standing out on the beach in a late summer evening, watching the waves roll in. As time passes, and only the moon is left illuminating the surface of the water, you begin to notice a soft white foam piling at the water’s edge. You remark to yourself:</p> <details> <p><summary> telo li pali e ko </summary></p> <p>The water is making foam.</p> <hr> <ul> <li>Water creates mud.</li> <li>Waterfalls erode rock into sand (create sand).</li> </ul> </details> <p>You and your friends are playing hide-and-seek. The one friend who is “it” is standing at the base of the tree, but only pretending to close their eyes while counting. As soon as the game starts, they rush to tag everyone they saw hide, and then when the game ends, everyone complains at once:</p> <details> <p><summary> sina pakala e musi! </summary></p> <p>You ruined the game!</p> <hr> <ul> <li>You tore up the boardgame!</li> <li>You broke the toy!</li> <li>You shattered the doll!</li> <li>You messed up the joke!</li> </ul> </details> <p>You’re a project manager, working with one of your developers on a new project. Your developer comes to you with a problem, and as you work through it, you identify the issue: one of the supporting tools has a change you don’t recognize. You check who wrote it, and inform the confused developer:</p> <details> <p><summary> sina ante e lipu </summary></p> <p>You changed the code…</p> <hr> <ul> <li>You edited the book</li> <li>Y’all appended to the textbook</li> <li>You altered the contract</li> <li>You amended the report</li> <li>You folded the paper</li> </ul> </details> <p>You’re late to a choir performance! You race from the parking lot to the auditorium doors, pushing them open with a <em>thump</em> and then pause- and listen. You hear the opening piece, and whisper under your breath:</p> <details> <p><summary> mi kute e kulupu </summary></p> <p>I hear the choir!</p> <hr> <ul> <li>I listen to the community</li> <li>I hear the group</li> <li>I overhear the family</li> <li>We listen to the neighborhood</li> </ul> </details> <p>A young child is confused- for years, she’s stayed home and spent all her time playing. Suddenly she now has to go to “school,” and spend so much time there! Her mom drops her off, crying and wailing, for her first day. Then mom shushes her and explains how school works, her child’s eyes widening as she listens:</p> <details> <p><summary> jan li pana e sona </summary></p> <p>People will teach you!</p> <hr> <ul> <li>People will give you knowledge.</li> <li>Somebody provides information.</li> <li>The person gives understanding.</li> </ul> </details> <p>On a walkthrough of a science museum, you find yourself in a hands-on exhibit full of boxes! You can’t see what’s inside, but the organizer directs you to reach in and feel. You reach into a box and feel something gooshy and rubbery. You squish it- but you have no idea what it is! The organizer tells you:</p> <details> <p><summary> sina pilin e ko! </summary></p> <p>You’re feeling the gum!</p> <hr> <ul> <li>You’re touching the goop.</li> <li>You’re feeling the moss.</li> <li>You’re touching the slime</li> <li>You’re in contact with the paste.</li> <li>Y’all are feeling sand.</li> <li>You felt the mud</li> <li>You touched the dust</li> </ul> </details> <p>You walk through the forest toward your personal getaway, a cozy cabin far from home. When you get there, you find the cabin in disrepair! Vines now creep up the sides, and weeds overgrow the garden; the home is clearly starved of care! You resolve to restore the garden and cabin, and remark to yourself:</p> <details> <p><summary> kasi li wile e pona! mi pona e kasi. </summary></p> <p>The garden needs help!
