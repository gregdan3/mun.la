The subject can now act on or apply changes to other things, with the use of <code>e</code>!</p> <blockquote> <p><code>[mi/sina] [verb/adjective] e [object]</code></p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><code>[subject] li [verb/adjective] e [object]</code></p> </blockquote> <details> <p><summary>A note about “predicate”</summary></p> <p>In common grammatical terms, “predicate” refers to the entire verb clause, including the object(s) of the sentence. It would be slightly more convenient, but disingenuous, to keep using predicate in place of the verb/adjective. I considered it wrong enough to replace, meaning the alternative is to always use “verb/adjective” instead… Which is differently disingenuous! You can’t win, unless you invent a word.</p> <p>Anyway, that grammatical position can be a verb, adjective, or both. It can also do other things which we’ll get to, and it is the <em>start</em> of the predicate.</p> </details> <p>In this kind of sentence, the subject usually applies the verb/adjective to the object. Here are a few examples:</p> <details> <p><summary> mi pona e jan </summary></p> <ul> <li>I help somebody.</li> <li>I improve people.</li> <li>I heal people.</li> <li>I tend to people.</li> <li>I make people feel better.</li> </ul> </details> <p>The <code>jan</code> becomes <code>pona</code> in some way, as in the translations given.</p> <details> <p><summary> lape li wawa e sina </summary></p> <ul> <li>Sleep makes you stronger</li> <li>Rest makes you confident</li> <li>Napping makes you energetic</li> <li>Relaxing energizes you</li> <li>Vacation empowers you</li> </ul> </details> <p>Here, <code>sina</code> becomes <code>wawa</code> in some way.</p> <p>Not every case is like this though! Here are some examples, using two new words:</p> <details> <p><summary> jan li pilin e kiwen </summary></p> <ul> <li>The person feels a rock.</li> <li>Somebody touched metal.</li> <li>Everyone touched this stone.</li> <li>People have been feeling this rock.</li> </ul> </details> <p>Here, the <code>kiwen</code> is <em>felt</em> or <em>touched</em>, but it never is or becomes <code>pilin</code>. Instead, the subject is the only one that does any <code>pilin</code>.</p> <details> <p><summary> mi wile e telo </summary></p> <ul> <li>I want water</li> <li>I need water</li> <li>I need (liquid) fuel</li> <li>I am thirsty</li> </ul> </details> <p>Again, the <code>telo</code> is <em>wanted</em> or <em>needed</em>, but it does not become <code>wile</code> or do the action <code>wile</code> or become describable by <code>wile</code>. The subject <em>wants</em>, <em>needs</em>, <code>wile</code> the <code>telo</code>.</p> <p>As you study, you’ll get an intuitive sense for this difference. Some words will be actions the subject takes on an object, but which do not change that object. Other words will change the object in some way, usually applying a new property to the object.</p> <details> <p><summary> A note on the above </summary></p> <p>As you become more advanced in Toki Pona’s grammar, you’ll learn that the above is somewhat disingenuous. It <em>is</em> possible to describe an object which becomes wanted as a wanted object, but for the time being, this simplification will work.</p> <p>That said, the following is possible:</p> <blockquote> <p>mi wile e telo.</p> </blockquote> <p>“I want water.”</p> <blockquote> <p>telo wile li pona e mi.</p> </blockquote> <p>“The water I want will make me feel better.”</p> <p>This uses a modifier to demonstrate the point, now referencing a “wanted liquid.”</p> </details> <h2 id=exercises>Exercises</h2> <h3 id=toki-pona-to-english>Toki Pona to English</h3> <p>A parent is doing his best to make his kid eat his dinner, resulting in an argument at the table. The kid offers the very reasonable point that vegetables are gross!

You hire a tutor to help, and they provide well-practiced teaching and piles of useful examples. Late one night, you are pouring over the textbook and you realize you actually understand every word. You exclaim:</p> <details> <p><summary> mi sona e lipu! </summary></p> <p>I understood the textbook!</p> <hr> </details> <p>Halloween night! A group of sheet-clad friends, dressed like classic ghosts, walk from home to home shouting “Trick or treat!” and get piles of sweets in hand at each door! At the end of the night, everyone compares their hauls. One friend pulls a weighty, dirty chunk from his bag and says…</p> <details> <p><summary> mi jo e kiwen… </summary></p> <p>I have a rock…</p> <hr> <ul> <li>I have metal.</li> <li>I own a pebble.</li> <li>I have a gem!</li> <li>I have gravel!</li> <li>I have a durable chunk.</li> <li>I got a brick.</li> </ul> </details> <p>You and your brother are up to no good, trying to play a prank the neighbor.

As time passes, and only the moon is left illuminating the surface of the water, you begin to notice a soft white foam piling at the water’s edge. You remark to yourself:</p> <details> <p><summary> telo li pali e ko </summary></p> <p>The water is making foam.</p> <hr> <ul> <li>Water creates mud.</li> <li>Waterfalls erode rock into sand (create sand).</li> </ul> </details> <p>You and your friends are playing hide-and-seek. The one friend who is “it” is standing at the base of the tree, but only pretending to close their eyes while counting. As soon as the game starts, they rush to tag everyone they saw hide, and then when the game ends, everyone complains at once:</p> <details> <p><summary> sina pakala e musi! </summary></p> <p>You ruined the game!</p> <hr> <ul> <li>You tore up the boardgame!</li> <li>You broke the toy!</li> <li>You shattered the doll!</li> <li>You messed up the joke!</li> </ul> </details> <p>You’re a project manager, working with one of your developers on a new project. Your developer comes to you with a problem, and as you work through it, you identify the issue: one of the supporting tools has a change you don’t recognize.

Suddenly she now has to go to “school,” and spend so much time there! Her mom drops her off, crying and wailing, for her first day. Then mom shushes her and explains how school works, her child’s eyes widening as she listens:</p> <details> <p><summary> jan li pana e sona </summary></p> <p>People will teach you!</p> <hr> <ul> <li>People will give you knowledge.</li> <li>Somebody provides information.</li> <li>The person gives understanding.</li> </ul> </details> <p>On a walkthrough of a science museum, you find yourself in a hands-on exhibit full of boxes! You can’t see what’s inside, but the organizer directs you to reach in and feel. You reach into a box and feel something gooshy and rubbery. You squish it- but you have no idea what it is!
