There are other languages that people have made too. You might know Valyrian from Game of Thrones, or Klingon from Star Trek. Those languages are from stories that many people know and love. But Toki Pona isn’t <em>from</em> a story, or anything- it’s for fun!</p> <p>About twenty years ago, Sonja Lang created Toki Pona- she’s told us why before, saying, “It was [her] [trying] to understand the meaning of life in one hundred and twenty words” and “” The language found a small but excited crowd back then, bringing in people interested in this new way of speaking. Today, there are many people in many different groups learning and speaking her language. In fact, Toki Pona grows and changes all on its own today thanks to these groups.</p> <p>But wait- you heard me say Toki Pona has 120 words, right? English has more words than you can remember, and so do most languages. Toki Pona has about 130 words today- Fewer words than bones in your body! And it gets away with this because each word can talk about many, many different ideas. ‘toki’ means ‘language’, but it also talks about conversation, thinking, speaking and more. ‘pona’ means ‘good’, but it also talks about things you enjoy, things that help you, things you care about, and more. So, the words “toki pona” could talk about a “good language”, or a “conversation with a friend”, or “ideas that help you feel better”, and way, way more. Let me explain it another way: there’s no word for “chair” like the English word “chair”, but there are many words you can use to talk about a chair. In short, Toki Pona is all about explaining what something is, or what something means to you!</p> <p>When you explain something in Toki Pona, you break that something down into small pieces, explain those pieces, and help your listener rebuild the original idea. It’s a lot like teaching- instead of using jargon, you explain an idea with comparisons, common experiences, or related ideas. You go back and forth, checking for understanding, until you’re both on the same page. Toki Pona is great at this- it doesn’t even have jargon to use!</p> <p>On that note: Often, when somebody discovers Toki Pona, they might assume its small vocabulary is a limit. You can’t talk about complicated things- how could you? That seems reasonable on the surface- There aren’t any complicated ideas in the language! But in reality, that couldn’t be further from the truth.</p> <p>On the note of creativity, and most important of all, Toki Pona is art. Toki Pona is art made by working together with others who speak Toki Pona.</p> <p>Toki Pona has a beautiful writing system</p> <p>Toki Pona is apt to Poetry, Music,</p> <hr> <p>At this point</p> <hr> <p>Two quick things I need to address before we go on: What Toki Pona is <em>not</em>.</p> <hr> <p>First: Many people, when they hear about Toki Pona’s small number of words, compare it to Newspeak in George Orwell’s dystopian novel 1984.</p> <p>The purpose of Newspeak is to prevent using language to organize rebellion or even think freely. It does so by being very simple- few words, few distinct concepts. Just like Toki Pona, right?</p> <p>But Toki Pona doesn’t do what Newspeak does in the story. In fact, the opposite is true- Toki Pona encourages, enables, even <em>grows</em> your creativity and expression.</p> <p>I’ve spoken Toki Pona for over two years now, and in that time, I’ve seen incredible art, music, poetry, deep discussions, presentations, and more.</p> <p>Given this, I don’t believe anything like Newspeak <em>could</em> hurt your creativity or expression- these would just take new forms in the new language.</p> <p>But either way, the only connection between Toki Pona and Newspeak is “simplicity.” And each use their simplicity in different ways.</p> <p>Toki Pona is not Newspeak. It’s a simple language, with simple rules, and is still endlessly creative and expressive</p> <hr> <p>Second: Many people, when they hear about Toki Pona’s small number of words, assume it can only than talk about the weather and what you ate today.</p> <p>Simply said, this is not true. You can communicate complex concepts in Toki Pona, and further, you can do so in few words even in English.</p> <hr> <p>But you might be wondering, Why is Toki Pona? Why should you learn it?</p> <p>In most languages, you’ll hear somebody say one thing but mean something else. They may be speaking figuratively, using metaphor, or using a common word in an uncommon or unexpected way. But when you ask them what they mean, the question isn’t always welcome. Even the most patient people will get frustrated when you don’t understand them, and worse, some people may not bother speaking to you after just one misunderstanding. This doesn’t happen in Toki Pona. Toki Pona relies on context, on common experiences, on mutual understandings- and every speaker understands this. Sometimes, you have to ask, “ni li seme?” What is this? and the question isn’t just welcome- it’s expected, and wanted!</p> <hr> <p>If Toki Pona is exciting to you, you might be asking, where can you learn it?</p> <ul> <li></li> </ul> <p>You can find all of these lessons in the description!</p> <p>There are new lessons being made for Toki Pona all the time. If there’s a good resource I didn’t list, I’ll</p> <p>Thank you so much for watching. I hope you learned something. And I hope you have something in your life which means as much to you as Toki Pona does to me.</p> </article> <footer> <p>Licensed under <a href=/LICENSE.txt>GPLv3</a>.</p> <p> Code on <a href=https://github.com/janKekanSan/jankekansan.github.io>my GitHub</a>. </p> </footer> <script src=/sptoggle.js></script> <script data-goatcounter=https://jankekansan.goatcounter.com/count async src=//gc.zgo.at/count.js></script> </body> </html>
