       <p>soweli is not like animal in English- it doesn't refer to any
kind of animal, just to a collection of creatures with sufficiently
similar traits (mammals + marsupials being a large majority of that)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What traits?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's harder to answer bc the category has grown out of many
examples. I would say the most common traits are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Warm Blooded</li>
<li>Fur/hair</li>
<li>Born alive (almost never born from eggs)</li>
</ul>
<p>But this list is not exhaustive either.</p>
<p>Also, a creature can have only some of these and still be considered
soweli (such as the platypus).</p>
<p>You can have overlapping traits and be in multiple categories (also
the platypus, living often in the water, is sometimes considered
kala).</p>
<p>And you can have many soweli traits but still be mostly considered
kala (dolphins, whales, seals) due to having more kala traits. These
might also be in multiple categories, depending on who you ask.</p>
<p>The categories operate based on feeling, and those feelings happen to
include a list of traits common to each category, but the feeling of a
creature is most important.</p>
<p>Bats are mammals, and animals, but they are not soweli. They have
leathery skin, so some speakers consider them akesi. They fly, so many
speakers consider them waso. They can be quite small, which some
speakers will consider small enough to be pipi.</p>
<p>So the better question to ask is, what does a creature feel like to
you, and to your listener? Use that information to express what you're
thinking of!</p>
<p>There's a related discussion about what a noka/luka is, which I'll
keep short with my favorite example from my own nasin, in addition to
counter-examples</p>
<p>I consider the wings of a bird to be noka, because they are
locomotive limbs. Some people consider them luka, because they are
anatomically analogous to arms (i.e. in the same part of the torso)</p>
<p>I consider the claws+feet of a bird to be luka when they are used to
grab things, and I consider them noka when they are used for walking or
standing. Some people consider them only noka because they're the only
obvious standing limbs on a bird, and others consider them only noka
because of anatomical analogy.</p>
<p>Again, feeling is important.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Interesting - so words are relative to the definitions of the
conversation partners moreso than in English.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's my experience, yes- I strive to consider the meanings of words
to my conversational partner, and this lets me better understand them
and them better understand me.</p>
<p>Fwiw, I think this applies just as much to English too- we just don't
think about it as often. Maybe because the definitions of English words
are more specific, so we assume others are operating on the same
specific definition? And that is correct often enough to not come up</p>
