It's a real language, and it's the easiest to start in.</p><p>You can learn all the words and have your first conversation in less than a week.</p><hr><p>It still takes time to be skilled, like any language, but there's other good news:</p><p>If you've ever struggled to learn a language on Duolingo, you probably need more conversations!</p><p>But it's hard to have conversations in a language you're new to- you have to find people who will be patient and correct you, but still interested in talking to you.</p><p>Well, the whole Toki Pona community will be patient, helpful, and speak with you, no matter your skill level.</p><hr><p>And there are lots of other reasons to try Toki Pona.</p><p>I feel that Toki Pona made me a better teacher, and more thoughtful about how I use all language.</p><p>You can use it to grow as an artist, writer, or software developer-</p><p>Or to make new friends by sharing the language.</p><p>Many in the community are queer, neurodivergent, or both- you'll find a home if that's you too.</p><p>And if nothing else, Toki Pona is perfect as a secret language for you and twenty-nine of your closest friends.</p><hr><p>If you wanna try Toki Pona, check out the lessons and communities in the description, and ask questions in the comments! I'll answer all that I can.</p><p>If you already speak Toki Pona, next time somebody asks, "What language is that?", show them this video!</p><p>And thank you so much for watching! o toki pona!</p></div><div class=footer><h2 class=tokipona>o toki tawa mi</h2><p><a href=https://youtube.com/@gregdan3d><img src=/buttons/youtube.gif alt="@gregdan3d on YouTube"class=button> </a><a href=https://github.com/gregdan3><img src=/buttons/github.gif alt="@gregdan3 on GitHub"class=button> </a><a href=https://discord.com/users/497549183847497739><img src=/buttons/discord.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Discord"class=button> </a><a href=https://gregdan3.t.me/ ><img src=/buttons/telegram.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Telegram"class=button></a></p><p>Generated by my <a href=https://github.com/gregdan3/SWGIG>Static Website Generator I Guess</a>.
