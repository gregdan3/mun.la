I wanna tell you about the easiest language, Toki Pona.</p><p>Toki Pona is a constructed language, like Klingon in Star Trek, or Valyrian in Game of Thrones.</p><p>But Toki Pona isn't for fiction- it's for fun! And it's so simple, you could teach it to a rock.</p><hr><p>But how does it work?</p><p>Toki Pona has very few words- 120 to 130, depending on who you ask.</p><p>And that works because all the words are broad like "bird" or "tool", rather than specific like "sparrow" or "jackhammer"</p><p>You might think that makes it hard to talk- but you already do this in English!</p><hr><p>If somebody asked you, "Want some fruit?", then offers a bowl of fruits you've never seen before, you might look at everything in the bowl and say, "Sure, I'll have this red one."</p><p>They didn't need to name each fruit, and you didn't either.</p><p>The word "fruit" is broad, covering all kinds of fruit.</p><p>And all you needed to do was describe the fruit you wanted!</p><p>In Toki Pona, every word is like this: broad and descriptive!</p><hr><p>This is true for the name of the language too:</p><p>"Toki" describes talking, conversation, language, thinking, and many similar things.</p><p>"Pona" describes good things like being friendly, positive, trustworthy, and more.</p><p>Together, "Toki Pona" can refer to friendly conversation, positive thought, or "good language".</p><hr><p>You can always use more words to be more specific, but a ton of fun comes from asking, "Can I say this more simply?"</p><p>Because of that, Toki Pona feels a bit like a puzzle or a game.</p><p>But Toki Pona isn't <em>just</em> for fun. It's a real language, and it's the easiest to start in.</p><p>You can learn all the words and have your first conversation in less than a week.</p><hr><p>It still takes time to be skilled, like any language, but there's other good news:</p><p>If you've ever struggled to learn a language on Duolingo, you probably need more conversations!</p><p>But it's hard to have conversations in a language you're new to- you need people who are interested in talking to you, but also patient and willing to correct you.</p><p>With Toki Pona, <em>everyone</em> will be patient, helpful, and excited to talk, no matter your skill level.</p><hr><p>And there are lots of other reasons to try Toki Pona.</p><p>I feel that Toki Pona made me a better teacher, and more thoughtful about how I use all language.</p><p>You can use it to grow as an artist, writer, or software developer-</p><p>Or to make new friends by sharing the language.</p><p>Many in the community are queer, neurodivergent, or both- and you'll find a home if that's you too.</p><p>If nothing else, Toki Pona is perfect as a secret language for you and twenty-nine of your closest friends.</p><hr><p>If you wanna learn Toki Pona, check the description for lessons and communities, and ask questions in the comments!</p><p>If you already speak Toki Pona, show this video to the next person who asks, "What's that language?"</p><p>And thank you so much for watching! o toki pona!</p></div><div class=footer><h2 class=tokipona>o toki tawa mi</h2><p><a href=https://youtube.com/@gregdan3d><img src=/buttons/youtube_s.gif alt="@gregdan3d on YouTube"class=social> </a><a href=https://github.com/gregdan3><img src=/buttons/github.gif alt="@gregdan3 on GitHub"class=social> </a><a href=https://discord.com/users/497549183847497739><img src=/buttons/discord_s.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Discord"class=social> </a><a href=https://gregdan3.t.me/ ><img src=/buttons/telegram_s.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Telegram"class=social></a></p><p>Generated by my <a href=https://github.com/gregdan3/SWGIG>Static Website Generator I Guess</a>.
