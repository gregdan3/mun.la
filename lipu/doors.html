Not just the gap made by opening the door- that is, the doorway- but the entire door: front-facing surface, gap, and concept, all in the word <span class=tp lang=tok>lupa</span>. It's like <span class=tp lang=tok>lupa</span> is a one-word lexicalization for "door".</p><p>The issue is, <strong>a door is not a hole!</strong> Or rather, it isn't <em>always</em> a hole. When a door is shut, it's a front-facing surface- a <span class=tp lang=tok>sinpin</span>. When you're talking about the door as a means to get to or from the inside of a building, that's a <span class=tp lang=tok>nasin</span>. But it is only when the door is open that it has a hole, and so it can only be described as a <span class=tp lang=tok>lupa</span> then.</p><p>But when I've pointed this out to some people, I've gotten some surprising pushback. Why isn't a door a <span class=tp lang=tok>lupa</span>? It has a hole sometimes, right? And we mainly use it for that reason- the hole lets us pass through it, which we do many times a day. What do you think of when you think of a door? Going through it. That's a <span class=tp lang=tok>lupa</span>, right?</p><p>It's more complicated than that. Let's think about it in terms of another common object: Ice! Ice is a solid, which is perfectly described with <span class=tp lang=tok>kiwen</span>. If you wanted to be specific about the type of <span class=tp lang=tok>kiwen</span>, you can add on <span class=tp lang=tok>telo</span> as a modifier, creating <span class=tp lang=tok>kiwen telo</span>. But you wouldn't put <span class=tp lang=tok>telo</span> first when describing ice. Ice is not a liquid, so <span class=tp lang=tok>telo</span> doesn't describe it correctly!</p><p>And I'd argue that calling a closed door a <span class=tp lang=tok>lupa</span> is a lot like referring to ice as <span class=tp lang=tok>telo kiwen</span>- Ice is only a liquid at other at other times, just like how a door is only a hole at other times. Put another way, you have the right idea with the concepts that you want to express, but they aren't correct <em>right now</em>.</p><p>Still, a lot of people use <span class=tp lang=tok>lupa</span> to refer to a door in <em>all</em> contexts. I suspect the disconnect comes from how we most often interact with doors, which is to open and shut them. The thing is, using <span class=tp lang=tok>lupa</span> to refer to a door in this context is <strong>actually fine</strong>! If you say "<span class=tp lang=tok>mi open e lupa</span>", that would mean "I open the hole." There's nothing wrong with that, because to open a door, you must turn it into a hole. The same goes for "<span class=tp lang=tok>mi pini e lupa</span>," which means "I close the hole." Again, there is no problem.</p><p>But what if you wanted to <strong>look at a door?</strong> Suddenly, the word you choose matters, because the door can be open or closed- so it could be <span class=tp lang=tok>lupa</span> or <span class=tp lang=tok>sinpin</span>. It could even be <span class=tp lang=tok>nasin</span>. Let's try it out:</p><p><img src=./soweli-sinpin.jpg></p><p>What is this cat doing? If we say "<span class=tp lang=tok>soweli li lukin e lupa</span>", "the cat is looking at a hole", we're being misleading- there is no hole there. There is a door, and the place where it stands is a hole at other times, but there is not <em>currently</em> a hole.</p><p>Because of that, it would be more apt to say "<span class=tp lang=tok>soweli li lukin e sinpin</span>," "the cat is looking at a front-facing surface" When the door is shut, it is a front-facing surface and not a hole- so the way we describe the door changes to match. Unlike when we open or shut the door, it matters <em>how</em> we refer to the door. The door is either open or shut in this moment, and that determines how you would describe it- just like the ice example from before.</p><p>That said, you <em>could</em> still refer to the door as a <span class=tp lang=tok>lupa</span> <em>if</em> it is in the context of it being a hole in those other times, such as talking about the past or future, a hypothetical, or a want for something to change. In doing this, we could instead describe the cat like so: "<span class=tp lang=tok>soweli li wile tawa lupa. taso lupa li pini</span>", "The cat wants to go through the doorway. But the doorway is closed." In this context, <span class=tp lang=tok>nasin</span> can fit just as well as <span class=tp lang=tok>lupa</span>.</p><p>All of this is to say, a door is not <em>always</em> a <span class=tp lang=tok>lupa</span>. But sometimes, it is! And now, you're equipped to recognize when you're using <span class=tp lang=tok>lupa</span> incorrectly, and find better ways to describe doors in <span class=tp lang=tok>toki pona</span>. Sometimes, you'll realize that <span class=tp lang=tok>lupa</span> is still the best way to refer to a door. But sometimes, you'll help someone realize they're making this same mistake.</p></div><div class=footer><h2 class=tp lang=tok>o toki tawa mi</h2><p><a href=https://youtube.com/@gregdan3d><img src=/buttons/youtube_s.gif alt="@gregdan3d on YouTube"class=button> </a><a href=https://github.com/gregdan3><img src=/buttons/github_s.gif alt="@gregdan3 on GitHub"class=button> </a><a href=https://discord.com/users/497549183847497739><img src=/buttons/discord_s.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Discord"class=button> </a><a href=https://gregdan3.t.me/ ><img src=/buttons/telegram_s.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Telegram"class=button></a></p></div><script src=/sptoggle.js></script><script data-goatcounter=https://jankekansan.goatcounter.com/count async src=//gc.zgo.at/count.js></script></div></html>
