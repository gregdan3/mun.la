"jan ni li wawa nasa li ike, li monsuta e mi!", "this person is strangely powerful, and evil, and scares me!"<p>and you can try this exercise with any word!</article><footer><h2>󱥄󱥬󱥩󱤴</h2><p class=buttons style=display:block><a href=https://youtube.com/@gregdan3d><img src=/buttons/youtube.gif alt="@gregdan3d on YouTube"> </a><a href=https://github.com/gregdan3><img src=/buttons/github.gif alt="@gregdan3 on GitHub"> </a><a href=https://discord.com/users/497549183847497739><img src=/buttons/discord.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Discord"> </a><a href=https://gregdan3.t.me/ ><img src=/buttons/telegram.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Telegram"></a><p>Generated by my <a href=https://github.com/gregdan3/SWGIG>Static Website Generator I Guess</a>.
