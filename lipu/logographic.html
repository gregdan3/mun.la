Even if you tried, any phonetic <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span> would either be the logographic system again or be worse than it, and <em>good luck</em> if you want to adapt <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span> to another language. You <em>can</em> make a phonetic system out of <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span>, but it won't see adoption.</p><h3 id=preamble>Preamble</h3><p>Near the end of January, the Unicode Consortium got back to us about <a href=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2024/24275-encode-sitelen-pona.pdf>our proposal to encode <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span> in Unicode</a>. You can <a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2025/25010-script-wg-report.pdf#page=10">see their comments here</a> in section 6.6 of their Q1-2025 meeting minutes. They did not have much to say, because our proposal is preliminary and thus not requesting any action to be taken at this time. However, they did provide some useful comments about our proposal, which will become important when we submit our finalized proposal.</p><p>But one of their comments was deeply confusing.</p><p>Per the following quote, the Unicode Consortium is concerned that <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span> may not be logographic. That is, they believe <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span> symbols may be or become used for their phonetic value (sound) rather than their semantic value (meaning).</p><blockquote><p>... there is no indication ... <strong>that [the script] is logographic in nature</strong> (which would make it constrained to the language).</p></blockquote><p>When we read this, we had no idea where their concern was coming from. We reached out via email to clarify this statement among others, and Jan Kuƒçera replied with the following:</p><blockquote><p>As an opened-ended [sic] system, and with examples as above, some members were not convinced the script indeed is or will remain logographic in the future, ...</p></blockquote><p>Restating this, our understanding of Unicode's initially stated concern is correct: some members of <a href=https://www.unicode.org/consortium/scriptadhoc.html>Unicode's Script Encoding Working Group</a> believe that <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span> is either not logographic, or that it may no longer be logographic at some point in the future.</p><p>But we're missing the "why." We intend to reach out for further comment in the future, but right now we're waiting on that. In the meantime, let's investigate the issue ourselves: How does a logographic writing system become phonetic? How long does it take? Could it happen to <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span>?</p><hr><h3 id=how-does-a-logographic-writing-system-become-phonetic>How does a logographic writing system become phonetic?</h3><p>I can't give a complete answer as to how a logographic writing system becomes phonetic, as I am not a linguist or other language-history expert. However, I can walk you through at least one demonstrative example:</p><p>Japanese's two phonetic syllabaries, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana>Hiragana</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana>Katakana</a>, both developed as a simplification of a prior system called <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27y%C5%8Dgana>Man'y≈çgana</a>, which was itself an adaptation of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_characters>Hanzi</a>. However, unlike the many <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinitic_languages>Sinitic languages</a> that primarily used these symbols for their meaning, Man'y≈çgana primarily used Hanzi characters for their sound in order to write Japanese. Specifically, the full sound of a Hanzi character would be used to represent some number of syllables in Japanese.</p><p>Linguists call this the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebus#Rebus_principle>rebus principle</a>, where a symbol is used for its sound rather than its meaning in order to write a word. This practice can be used to write names, such as the example of Ramesses II given in the linked article, but it can be used to write essentially anything- and it often occurs when adapting a language's logographic writing system to another language. This is exactly how Man'y≈çgana arose.</p><p>That said, a writing system does not have to be adapted to a different language for the rebus principle to be used- it can occur within the same language so long as a given symbol has a sound that can be reused within that language. This can even be done in English via emoji, where the eye emoji <code>üëÅÔ∏è</code> can be read for its sound and not what it depicts, thus representing the first person pronoun "I."</p><p>I'll also note for completeness that a symbol does not have to be used for its entire sound (as in the rebus principle) to be used phonetically. It is possible to use only the first consonant or vowel, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mora_(linguistics)>mora</a>, syllable, or another partial or modified reading of the character. That said- and this is a <em>lightly educated guess</em>, not fact- I'd assume that most of these were rare and widely unconsidered before the studies of phonetics and linguistics were widespread.</p><p>This is important to clarify though, because <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span> as defined in <em>Toki Pona: The Language of Good</em> already has one of these systems available, where symbols in a cartouche are read by their first letter. Further, there are other community-made systems for writing names which are based on morae instead.</p><hr><p>But does <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span> even make a good phonetic script? Personally, I don't think so. My hypothesis is that cartouches will remain the only means by which <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span> is written phonetically, while the majority of <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span> writing will remain logographic. Here's my argument for why:</p><h3 id=phonetic-sitelenpona-is-only-good-at-writing-tokipona>Phonetic <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span> is only good at writing <span class=tp lang=tok>toki+pona</span></h3><p><span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span>'s existing phonetic system and the community-made extensions to it are extremely limited in what sounds they are able to express. However, these limits do not come from the systems themselves. In fact, these community extensions are generally created to <em>add to</em> the capabilities of the cartouche system from <em>Toki Pona: The Language of Good</em>. These additions often make names more compact by writing morae rather than letters, and offer more variety of symbols for writing names.</p><p>However, these changes do not escape the biggest limitation of phonetic writing in <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span>, which is <span class=tp lang=tok>toki+pona</span>'s own vocabulary. An extreme example of this issue can be seen in the options available to write "e" in the initial-letter-based system defined in <em>Toki Pona: The Language of Good</em>, because the only options are <span class=tp lang=tok>e</span>, <span class=tp lang=tok>en</span>, and <span class=tp lang=tok>esun</span>. (Anecdotally, those trying to write their own name are routinely frustrated by the limited ways to write "e"). Generalizing this, <span class=tp lang=tok>toki+pona</span> does not equally distribute the letters of its latin alphabet across its words, and phonetic <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span> inherits this trait.</p><p>To demonstrate: While these systems offer more ways to write "e" <em>if</em> it comes after a consonant, morae like "pe", "ju", and "nu" are unavailable without falling back on the less effective letter-based system, and several morae like "pu" or "je" have only a single option available, or are only available after other sounds. (And again, this is a routine point of frustration for those writing their own names).</p><p>Summarizing the above, phonetic <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span> is only particularly good at writing words which are already in <span class=tp lang=tok>toki+pona</span> because the needed sounds are already available in the desired order via <span class=tp lang=tok>toki+pona</span>'s vocabulary. Name writing is not <em>much</em> more challenging than that, but a variety of sounds which <span class=tp lang=tok>toki+pona</span>'s phonotactics allow are not possible to represent as more compact morae, and so must be written while treating <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span> as a poor alphabet.</p><p>Based on the above, not only is <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span> only <em>okay</em> at writing names that follow <span class=tp lang=tok>toki+pona</span>'s phonotactics,' it would be <em>extremely bad</em> at writing languages other than <span class=tp lang=tok>toki+pona</span> unless its sounds were significantly altered for that purpose. There are extremely few other languages with as few sounds to represent, and as demonstrated, phonetic <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span> has significant limits even for writing sounds that are allowed in <span class=tp lang=tok>toki+pona</span>.</p><h3 id=phonetic-sitelenpona-is-worse-than-logographic-sitelenpona>Phonetic <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span> is worse than logographic <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span></h3><p>Phonetic <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span> is a much less efficient format for conveying <span class=tp lang=tok>toki+pona</span> than logographic <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span>. I touched on this briefly in the prior section while discussing compactness of the various name writing systems, but the issue is much larger than I portrayed then. The loss in efficiency of any phonetic system versus the logographic one can be demonstrated visually with ease. Compare these options for writing the sound "toki", ordered from least to most compact:</p><table><thead><tr><th>System</th><th>Writing</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Alphabetic</td><td><span class=tp lang=tok>[taso olin kasi ike]</span> or <span class=tp lang=tok>[tawa ona kala insa]</span></td></tr><tr><td>Moraic</td><td><span class=tp lang=tok>[tomo. kili.]</span> or <span class=tp lang=tok>[tonsi. kin.]</span></td></tr><tr><td>Unmarked moraic</td><td><span class=tp lang=tok>[tomo kili]</span> or <span class=tp lang=tok>[tonsi kin]</span></td></tr><tr><td>Rebus</td><td><span class=tp lang=tok>[toki:]</span></td></tr><tr><td>Unmarked rebus</td><td><span class=tp lang=tok>[toki]</span></td></tr><tr><td>Logographic</td><td><span class=tp lang=tok>toki</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p>As you can see, each of these markings become progressively smaller until they ultimately represent the word again. Even if you ignore the cartouches, the only phonetic systems which can compare to the efficiency of logographic <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span> are essentially identical to writing logographically.</p><p>The problem of compactness only becomes worse for longer words and names where the efficiency of writing the word drops even further, and this doesn't even consider the massively expanded number of ways to write any given word. Even if you assume that users of phonetic <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span> will settle on a single way to write each sound or at least each word<a href=#fn1 class=footnote-ref id=fnref1 role=doc-noteref><sup>1</sup></a>, all words would have a significantly longer representation in the phonetic writing system than the logographic system, but not gain any new expressive power over the Latin alphabet.</p><p>Now, I'll grant that "It should be logographic! Look how short it is to write!" is a bad argument <em>on its own</em>. Compactness is not the only consideration in a writing system; after all, making a logography for English would be absurd, because it has hundreds of thousands of words, and even <a href=TODO>simplified versions of it</a> still have over a thousand words. However, <span class=tp lang=tok>toki+pona</span>'s vocabulary of only 120-130 words requires only that many logographs to fully represent it- that many symbols needed to read and write the language.</p><p>This means the efficiency advantage of an alphabet or syllabary over a logography is much smaller for <span class=tp lang=tok>toki+pona</span> than any natural language. Let's examine the math of it.</p><p>For an alphabetic writing system, you would only need 14 symbols to represent <span class=tp lang=tok>toki+pona</span>: One for each letter <span class=tp lang=tok>toki+pona</span> uses. <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span> has over 100 "letters", and agreeing on which to use for what letter would likely take decades if it could ever be achieved.</p><p>For a moraic writing system, you would need around 50 symbols, but <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span> can't represent them all based on the initial mora of <span class=tp lang=tok>toki+pona</span>'s words- you'd need to create new rules/readings to make up the difference, or just write some words logographically anyway. Even then, you would still need to know about half as many symbols as there are words in the language, which makes for an even smaller gap between it and a logography.</p><p>It's also worth reiterating that all of these flaws of phonetic <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span> affect its ability to write <em>any language</em>, not just <span class=tp lang=tok>toki+pona</span></p><p>To summarize, <em>an</em> alphabet would be more efficient than logographic <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span>. It already exists, and is called the Latin alphabetic. But <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span> does not make a good alphabet, and the rest of the phonetic systems for <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span> are worse than it.</p><h3 id=every-tokipona-speaker-already-knows-the-latin-alphabet>Every <span class=tp lang=tok>toki+pona</span> speaker already knows the Latin alphabet</h3><p>and like, let's not forget that virtually if not literally every speaker of toki pona already knows the latin alphabet, which is inextricably and likely permanently toki pona's primary writing system- and it's objectively more useful than any phonetic system sitelen pona could convey, including its own built in one, even if you artificially limit it to toki pona's phonotactics. there's a huge pressure to just use the latin alphabet rather than make up a new system that you'd have to push everyone to learn first.</p><h3 id=mixing-phonetic-and-logographic-sitelenpona-cannot-work>Mixing phonetic and logographic <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span> cannot work</h3><p>It also bears mentioning that <span class=tp lang=tok>toki pona</span>'s highly limited grammar prevents virtually any phonetic system from omitting cartouches unless it wholly replaced the existing logographic system. Without a cartouche, phonetic writing with <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen pona</span> blurs into the surrounding sentence, making it nearly impossible to separate . I'll grant, somebody could make a totally new system or marking that could better distinguish between symbols used for their sound and symbols used for their meaning. But even if that tool were created, or if <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span> were written entirely phonetically in some idealized system, it would still only be <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span> would only be capable of writing</p><p>this one can't be discounted, but even an idealized phonetic system made with sitelen pona is still not gonna be very good at writing anything except for toki pona... in which case, why would anyone bother?</p><p>so, that's my argument for why non-logographic sitelen pona won't happen. summarizing: phonetic writing systems made with sitelen pona will only really be good at writing toki pona, but they'd probably be worse than sitelen pona <em>and</em> have to be taught. and otherwise, the latin alphabet is right there, and way better at this job.</p><hr><p>By the way, if you take this article as a challenge to create a better phonetic system out of <span class=tp lang=tok>sitelen+pona</span>, whether to write <span class=tp lang=tok>toki+pona</span> or other languages, <a href=TODO>please do so and share</a>! I'd love to see what you come up with. But be aware, you can't just tack new sounds onto these symbols- whatever system you create needs to be reasonably familiar to existing speakers, and easy to explain!</p><section id=footnotes class="footnotes footnotes-end-of-document"role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn1><p>So we're clear, this assumption is <em>lofty.</em> Even for the fact that <span class=tp lang=tok>toki+pona</span> only has a few thousand speakers at most.<a href=#fnref1 class=footnote-back role=doc-backlink>‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li></ol></section></div><div class=footer><h2 class=tp lang=tok>o toki tawa mi</h2><p><a href=https://youtube.com/@gregdan3d><img src=/buttons/youtube_s.gif alt="@gregdan3d on YouTube"class=button> </a><a href=https://github.com/gregdan3><img src=/buttons/github_s.gif alt="@gregdan3 on GitHub"class=button> </a><a href=https://discord.com/users/497549183847497739><img src=/buttons/discord_s.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Discord"class=button> </a><a href=https://gregdan3.t.me/ ><img src=/buttons/telegram_s.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Telegram"class=button></a></p></div><script src=/sptoggle.js></script><script data-goatcounter=https://jankekansan.goatcounter.com/count async src=//gc.zgo.at/count.js></script></div></html>
