There are tons of resources, regular opportunities to practice translation and conversation, and many spaces to ask questions! There will always be room to do better, but the size of the community speaks for itself- if somebody wants to become conversational in Toki Pona, they won't have any trouble finding resources or communities to achieve that.</p><p>However, there is a persistent gap in the learning process for anyone wanting to be more than conversational in toki pona. Outside of a few specific spaces or the vicinity of already skilled speakers, there are very few opportunities to listen to or speak toki pona above a conversational level. Having observed the community for over three years and run events for over two years, I'd describe the causes like so:</p><ul><li><strong>Communities and languages are not conversations.</strong> A community is a space where conversation takes place, and languages are mediums of conversation. You can learn all of the basics of toki pona with a list of words, grammar rules, and lots of sentences to practice on- but you need conversations, something to talk about, to really get good!</li><li><strong>Most members of the community are learners.</strong> This makes it hard to find somebody to talk to above that basic level of conversational. You can become skilled without that help- that has to be true, because toki pona didn't exist before 2001! But having so many learners creates another problem:</li><li><strong>Most members of the community speak English</strong>, so there is massive pressure to fall back on English for understanding- especially among learners. Any space that allows English but doesn't create a space or time for Toki Pona will end up speaking almost entirely English. Even spaces where Toki Pona is heavily encouraged can experience this because of how much easier it is to speak English.</li><li><strong>New spaces make great conversation, but lose momentum.</strong> The most common strategy for creating a dedicated space for Toki Pona is to create channels for it in Discord. New channels usually get a burst of initial excitement, but then go quiet as nobody checks them anymore. There are many reasons why this happens, but the most important is that persistent and interested audience- and getting that audience is hard.</li><li><strong>Events make great conversation, but are hard.</strong> Collectively, we lack experience <em>and</em> have high expectations for ourselves and the events we run. Despite that, many of us have never run an event before and don't know where to start. Often, we assume that every event should run like a perfectly tuned <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine>Rube Goldberg machine</a>, running flawlessly from start to finish with something captivating happening at every moment. We want every event to be <span class=tp lang=tok>suno pi toki pona</span>, but that isn't realistic.</li><li><strong>Nobody wants to be excluded!</strong> If you make a space or event which only allows Toki Pona, a lot of people will simply never join. There are tons of reasons for this, but most boil down to feeling unable to participate, such as feeling unconfident, unskilled, or uninvited.</li></ul><p>To address the above, we should first delineate which of these are solvable problems, and which are unsolvable.</p><ul><li><p><strong>We cannot help the fact that communities and languages only facilitate conversation.</strong> Talking about toki pona is extremely fun, but it isn't to everyone's taste, and it only goes so far. After that, you need something new to talk about.</p></li><li><p><strong>We cannot help the fact that most of the community is learners.</strong> toki pona is fascinating to the right type of person, and we draw in that sort of person all the time! The reality is, the community's skilled speakers may <em>always</em> be outnumbered by new learners, and there is only so much we can do to close that gap with education.</p></li><li><p><strong>We can help the fact that most of the community speaks English</strong>, but that is not my focus for this article. I do briefly discuss the issue and how to address it in this footnote[^english-speakers], but I believe the other problems are either more important to solve first or lead to helping this anyway.</p></li><li><p><strong>We can help the fact that running events is hard.</strong> Events do not <em>have</em> to be hard- we just have to plan simpler events. I've personally run several events in <span class=tp lang=tok>ma pona pi toki pona</span>, and dozens in <span class=tp lang=tok>ma toki pona [wile.jan.]</span>- the former is exhausting and prone to error, while the latter is comfortable and easy. In my opinion, the difference is in preparation, expectation, and help.</p></li><li><p><strong>We can help people to not feel excluded</strong>, up to a point. Events can be designed in such a way that, even though they are "toki pona only," they can be accessible to learners- not only to listen to, but to participate in! We can't bridge this gap for everyone, but we can absolutely do better.</p></li></ul><p>fact that most of the community speaks English- it's also possible this literal fact will never change. But its consequences could change. The reason the community is primarily English speaking is that most resources for learning toki pona are in English, and most of the community is English speaking. Changing this would mean creating more learning materials in languages other than English, and discouraging English from use- which can at least be done with toki pona itself!</p><p>Given all of this, do you think we could run <strong>more, better, and easier events</strong> which <strong>require toki pona</strong> but are still <strong>accessible to learners?</strong></p><h2 id=how-to-do-better>How to do better</h2><h3 id=event-running-is-easier-than-you-think>Event Running is easier than you think</h3><p>There is an instinct to be massively over-prepared for running an event. Newbies to event running often want to get lists of every participant, put them into an exact order, know what they're doing ahead of time, create tons of advertising materials, and even plan the entire <em>next</em> entire event in advance.</p><p>It is true that you need to be prepared to run an event, but you'd be surprised at how little you <em>need</em> in order to be ready! For most purposes, these are your only <em>necessary</em> responsibilities:</p><ul><li>Have something to do during the event!</li><li>Choose what day and time the event starts!</li><li>Remind everyone that the event is coming up to build hype!</li><li>Be present during the event to make sure things run smoothly!</li></ul><p>And then you have a few <em>optional</em> responsibilities:</p><ul><li>Start with something exciting!</li><li>End with something exciting!</li><li>Have an incentive for participating, like a contest with rewards or an opportunity for community-wide exposure and recognition!</li></ul><p>If you've participated in <span class=tp lang=tok>suno pi toki pona</span> before, you'll notice that it meets all of these requirements fantastically, but it is also <strong>very</strong> planned out ahead of time. You don't need <strong>Don't try to create <span class=tp lang=tok>suno pi toki pona</span>!!</strong></p><h3 id=speaking-toki-pona-is-easier-than-you-think>Speaking Toki Pona is easier than you think</h3><h3 id=only-toki-pona-is-more-flexible-than-you-think>"Only Toki Pona" is more flexible than you think</h3><p>There is a reflex from especially skilled and invested speakers of Toki Pona to seriously over-correct, enforcing that only Toki Pona is used for entire events or communities. It is their prerogative to do so, and I respect the effort- Toki Pona is capable of any conversation you need it for, and we should not artifically limit it out of a mistaken belief that Toki Pona <em>isn't</em> capable.</p><p>However, we need to be realistic on this point: Just because <em>you personally</em> can use toki pona to express anything, does not mean everyone else can do so- a huge number of people in the community are in the learning process, and will still need help</p><p>To encourage people to speak toki pona, you should <strong>use English as a tool</strong> to advertise events, create hype, and share excitement. Then, once that's done, <strong>speak only toki pona</strong> for the entire event! This way, you cast <strong>as wide a net as possible</strong> for your target audience, bringing in interested people who may not be confident enough in their toki pona skill to follow the announcement.</p><p>And to be clear: the event <strong>has to be only toki pona</strong>! But that line is malleable- you can keep casting a wide net by making a space where other languages can be spoken while the main event remains only toki pona. Discord voice chats are a great example of this, since the voice chat can be in toki pona while the text chat is in English for learners to ask questions.</p><h2 id=questions-and-clarifications>Questions and Clarifications</h2><h3 id=what-if-my-event-is-for-learners>What if my event is for learners?</h3><p>Do what you want! I have thoughts about how best to design an event for totally new learners, but the focus of this article is creating opportunities to speak toki pona at an intermediate and advanced level.</p><h3 id=why-does-it-need-to-be-only-toki-pona>Why does it need to be <strong>only</strong> toki pona?</h3><p>There are a few other ways that the toki pona community organizes events. Summarizing them:</p><ul><li>Just an event, without any specific language required.</li><li></li></ul><h3 id=does-the-entire-event-need-to-be-only-toki-pona>Does the <strong>entire</strong> event need to be only toki pona?</h3><h2 id=considerations>Considerations</h2><h3 id=english-isnt-going-away>English isn't going away</h3><p>For better or worse, English is the primary language of many Toki Pona speakers. There are plenty of spaces which only allow toki pona, or at least cordon off English to a small corner of the space, but these tend to lack focus, activity, or even participants in many cases.</p><p>The largest and most active Toki Pona spaces are so large and active because most of their activity is in English. These communities undoubtedly are successful in growing interest in Toki Pona, but they very rarely take that next step of growing Toki Pona's <em>use</em>.</p><p>But if we consider a space to be successful because it encourages the most <em>use</em> of Toki Pona, these much larger English-first spaces are still the most successful communities, encouraging the most volume</p><p>Conversely, the spaces which only allow Toki Pona are much quieter- they aren't dead, but they tend to be occupied by a small number of more invested Toki Pona speakers who are willing to put up with limited activity in order to not have English influence or interrupt conversations.</p><p>If we'd like to bridge this gap, we should accept that English is a part of the community and use it as a tool to grow Toki Pona.</p><h3 id=english-takes-topics-away-from-toki-pona>English takes topics away from toki pona</h3><p>If you're in a group of Toki Pona speakers, and you discuss something in English, none of you will ever end up having that discussion in Toki Pona later. After all, why would you? Reiterating the initial conversation would be akin to a translation exercise- not a conversation unto itself. That's great for learners, but often boring for experienced speakers!</p><p>Every conversation in English, especially those which study toki pona, takes away a discussion that could have been in toki pona. This isn't to say that <em>every</em> conversation needs to be in toki pona- but many that could <em>easily</em> be in toki pona are not.</p><p>A common example would be conversations that study Toki Pona. Broadly speaking, most conversations <em>about</em> toki pona are to study it. This is true for both learners and experienced speakers, where learners are using a language they already know to study toki pona, and experienced speakers are discussing specific ways they and others use toki pona... in English. While learners are (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwYL9_SRAk8EXSZPSTm9lm2kD_Z1RzUgm">mostly</a>) off the hook for using English to learn, experienced speakers have no excuse!</p><p>You might think this isn't a problem- those conversations are just as much using English as a tool to grow Toki Pona as any other, right? Somebody is</p><p>The trouble is that there are <em>so many</em> conversations about Toki Pona which are not <em>in</em> it, to the point that several turns of phrase have developed to refer to these conversations, such as the phrase "nasin discussion."</p><h3 id=the-community-wants-more-toki-pona>The community wants more toki pona</h3><p>Within the community, there are many speakers who want more opportunities to speak toki pona. There are frequent complaints about English entirely consuming conversations, and about being ignored when attempting to speak toki pona in a conversation that is currently primarily in English.</p><p>To those who joined the community to speak toki pona, this is deeply frustrating. It is</p><p>This is especially true of toki pona's most invested speakers, who love the language dearly. Both of these groups would like to use toki pona in new ways, to explore what it is capable of, and challenge themselves to learn more about new topics in new conversations- among any number of other personal motivations for speaking toki pona. But opportunities to actually explore the boundaries of toki pona do not come up often.</p><!-- ### The community is highly centralized --><h3 id=english-is-easy-toki-pona-is-hard>English is easy, Toki Pona is hard</h3><p>Or alternatively, speaking Toki Pona is low engagement, because the average reader is not skilled enough in Toki Pona to read it as quickly as they would read an equivalent English statement-</p><p>This is an issue that the community and its members frequently run into.
