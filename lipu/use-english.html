There are frequent complaints about English entirely consuming conversations, and about being ignored when attempting to speak toki pona in a conversation that is currently primarily in English.</p><p>To those who joined the community to speak toki pona, this is deeply frustrating. It is</p><p>This is especially true of toki pona's most invested speakers, who love the language dearly. Both of these groups would like to use toki pona in new ways, to explore what it is capable of, and challenge themselves to learn more about new topics in new conversations- among any number of other personal motivations for speaking toki pona. But opportunities to actually explore the boundaries of toki pona do not come up often.</p><h3 id=the-community-is-highly-centralized>The community is highly centralized</h3><p>If community centralization is a concern to you, then my advice is important to you as well. In short, a small number of toki pona communities account for the majority of toki pona conversation.</p><p>From my work on <a href=https://gregdan3.github.io/ilo-muni/ >ilo Muni</a>, I discovered that <a href=https://discord.gg/mapona>ma pona pi toki pona</a> has 57.1% of all toki pona text; this covers Discord, Telegram, and Reddit. There are only a handful of platforms with large enough toki pona communities to make a dent in this figure- namely, Facebook, Tumblr, and YouTube. Even then, I'd expect ma pona pi toki pona to only barely lose its majority with these platforms added.</p><p>However, ma pona pi toki pona is only 50.4% of toki pona sentences in the past year (August 2023 to August 2024). This is still a majority, but a much smaller one, and much more likely to be toppled by the addition of the missing platforms. This shift is because toki pona speakers are making more communities than ever before, and because more of these communities are successful than ever before. These two are, in turn, caused by there being <strong>more toki pona speakers</strong> with more diverse interests and desires than ever before.</p><details class=details><summary class=summary><strong>Why is ma pona pi toki pona so large?</strong></summary><p>Additionally, the 'blame' for the size of ma pona pi toki pona is not solely on it. It's a matter of platform design, and how different platforms encourage different conversation. In ilo Muni's data, Discord makes up 91.1% of all written toki pona, likely due to its design encouraging fast-paced live and continuous conversation. Among all the popular platforms where toki pona is spoken, only Telegram comes close to this design</p><p>While Telegram is fairly similar to Discord in encouraging many short messages, it is much less adopted in the community. Reddit, Facebook, and Tumblr all encourage</p><p>Of course, a much larger centralization problem is Discord as a platform, which is 91.1% of all of my data. I'm working on gathering more, but to be frank, there simply isn't enough written toki pona left on the internet to make a dent in this figure.</p></details><details class=details><summary class=summary><strong>Why not get rid of ma pona pi toki pona?</strong></summary></details><p>Also,</p><p>If there were more toki pona speakers, especially skilled ones, there would be more communities to match- this is already an observably true if small effect. This may not make a difference in platform centralization, since that's governed by entirely different phenomena, but it would make a difference in community centralization.</p><h2 id=challenges>Challenges</h2><h3 id=english-isnt-going-away>English isn't going away</h3><p>For better or worse, English is the primary language of many of toki pona's speakers. There are plenty of spaces which only allow toki pona, or at least cordon off English to a small corner of the space, but these tend to lack focus, activity, or even participants in many cases. The most successful spaces in terms of raw activity are those where English is the primary language, but it would be better to frame "success" in terms of the amount of toki pona spoken. In that case, the most successful spaces are still those where English the primary language- there just happens to be enough Toki Pona going on at the same time.</p><h3 id=most-conversations-about-toki-pona-are-to-study-it>Most conversations about toki pona are to study it</h3><p>This is true for both learners and experienced speakers, where learners are using a language they already know to study toki pona, and experienced speakers are discussing specific ways they and others use toki pona... in English. While learners are (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwYL9_SRAk8EXSZPSTm9lm2kD_Z1RzUgm">mostly</a>) off the hook for using English to learn, experienced speakers using English is what we're here to discuss!</p><h3 id=most-conversations-about-toki-pona-do-not-change-it>Most conversations about toki pona do not change it</h3><p>Or stated more aptly, most conversations <em>about</em> toki pona do not further what is possible in it- there is only so much you can do to influence a language without speaking it!</p><p>Learner conversations can't influence toki pona much, because learners need a base understanding of toki pona before furthering the language- or to even know what to further.</p><p>But even for experienced speakers, most of their conversations about toki pona are studies, analyses, or explorations- all in English. These almost never make their way to toki pona, whether as conversations or usage. Put another way, English conversation about the use of toki pona rivals how much toki pona is actually used, <em>and</em> doesn't influence toki pona very much.</p><p>This isn't to say these conversations have <em>no</em> influence. If nothing else, these conversations are an important part of how people explore and enjoy toki pona, and have been for as long as I've been around- I've been a part of that too! But that isn't the full story, because there are many more ways to engage with toki pona that <em>do</em> influence it and lead to both greater and <em>new</em> understanding.</p><h3 id=using-english-takes-topics-away-from-toki-pona>Using English takes topics away from toki pona</h3><p>If a topic is first discussed in a language other than toki pona, there's no reason to discuss it in toki pona anymore.</p><p>If all of those who would be interested in a given topic (e.g. a new analysis of toki pona) engage with it in English first, why would they re-engage with it in toki pona, or have later conversations about it in toki pona? Reiterating the initial conversation would be akin to a translation exercise- not a conversation unto itself. That's great for learners, but often boring for experienced speakers!</p><p>Every conversation in English, especially those which study toki pona, takes away a discussion that could have been in toki pona. This isn't to say that <em>every</em> conversation needs to be in toki pona- but many that could <em>easily</em> be in toki pona are not.</p><h3 id=speaking-toki-pona-sees-low-engagement>Speaking toki pona sees low engagement</h3><p>Or stated conversely, English is easy and toki pona is hard.</p><p>This is an issue that the community and its members frequently run into. I've seen easily dozens of independent realizations of this fact.</p><h2 id=realizations>Realizations</h2><h3 id=studying-toki-pona-in-english-limits-toki-pona-and-you>Studying toki pona in English limits toki pona and you</h3><p>If you're a learner, this section doesn't apply to you so much, although I recommend learning from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwYL9_SRAk8EXSZPSTm9lm2kD_Z1RzUgm">o pilin e toki pona</a> if you'd like to take my advice as hard as you can!</p><p>If you're an experienced speaker, I strongly believe that using English to study toki pona is a limit for you, for your skill in the language, and maybe even your long term interest in the language. Studying toki pona via English means removing a topic of conversation from toki pona, and thus removing an opportunity to challenge yourself and learn more about toki pona.</p><p>If you're interested in toki pona as an object of research, having those discussions or displaying your results in English means the exact same thing for you, but from a different angle: Your object of study will ultimately be less interesting than it could be. Your studies will draw interest from active speakers, but they'll have those discussions with you in English- you didn't create an opportunity for them to speak toki pona, so toki pona did not grow.</p><h3 id=summary>Summary</h3><ul><li>Most conversations about toki pona are to study it.</li><li>Most conversations studying toki pona are in English.</li><li>If you're studying toki pona in English, you probably aren't influencing the language much.</li><li></li><li>But despite all of the above points, it's</li></ul><h2 id=my-advice>My Advice</h2><p>Use English as a tool.
