There are plenty of spaces which only allow toki pona, or at least cordon off English to a small corner of the space, but these tend to lack focus, activity, or even participants in many cases.</p><p>The largest and most active Toki Pona spaces are so large and active because most of their activity is in English. These communities undoubtedly are successful in growing interest in Toki Pona, but they very rarely take that next step of growing Toki Pona's <em>use</em>.</p><p>But if we consider a space to be successful because it encourages the most <em>use</em> of Toki Pona, these much larger English-first spaces are still the most successful communities, encouraging the most volume</p><p>Conversely, the spaces which only allow Toki Pona are much quieter- they aren't dead, but they tend to be occupied by a small number of more invested Toki Pona speakers who are willing to put up with limited activity in order to not have English influence or interrupt conversations.</p><p>If we'd like to bridge this gap, we should accept that English is a part of the community and use it as a tool to grow Toki Pona.</p><h3 id=english-takes-topics-away-from-toki-pona>English takes topics away from toki pona</h3><p>If you're in a group of Toki Pona speakers, and you discuss something in English, none of you will ever end up having that discussion in Toki Pona later. After all, why would you? Reiterating the initial conversation would be akin to a translation exercise- not a conversation unto itself. That's great for learners, but often boring for experienced speakers!</p><p>Every conversation in English, especially those which study toki pona, takes away a discussion that could have been in toki pona. This isn't to say that <em>every</em> conversation needs to be in toki pona- but many that could <em>easily</em> be in toki pona are not.</p><p>A common example would be conversations that study Toki Pona. Broadly speaking, most conversations <em>about</em> toki pona are to study it. This is true for both learners and experienced speakers, where learners are using a language they already know to study toki pona, and experienced speakers are discussing specific ways they and others use toki pona... in English. While learners are (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwYL9_SRAk8EXSZPSTm9lm2kD_Z1RzUgm">mostly</a>) off the hook for using English to learn, experienced speakers have no excuse!</p><p>You might think this isn't a problem- those conversations are just as much using English as a tool to grow Toki Pona as any other, right? Somebody is</p><p>The trouble is that there are <em>so many</em> conversations about Toki Pona which are not <em>in</em> it, to the point that several turns of phrase have developed to refer to these conversations, such as the phrase "nasin discussion."</p><h3 id=the-community-wants-more-toki-pona>The community wants more toki pona</h3><p>Within the community, there are many speakers who want more opportunities to speak toki pona. There are frequent complaints about English entirely consuming conversations, and about being ignored when attempting to speak toki pona in a conversation that is currently primarily in English.</p><p>To those who joined the community to speak toki pona, this is deeply frustrating. It is</p><p>This is especially true of toki pona's most invested speakers, who love the language dearly. Both of these groups would like to use toki pona in new ways, to explore what it is capable of, and challenge themselves to learn more about new topics in new conversations- among any number of other personal motivations for speaking toki pona. But opportunities to actually explore the boundaries of toki pona do not come up often.</p><!-- ### The community is highly centralized --><h2 id=how>How?</h2><h3 id=create>Create</h3><h3 id=encourage>Encourage</h3><h3 id=run-events>Run Events</h3><h3 id=speak-toki-pona-to-those-who-know-it>Speak Toki Pona to those who know it</h3><h2 id=challenges>Challenges</h2><h3 id=english-is-easy-toki-pona-is-hard>English is easy, Toki Pona is hard</h3><p>Or alternatively, speaking Toki Pona is low engagement, because the average reader is not skilled enough in Toki Pona to read it as quickly as they would read an equivalent English statement-</p><p>This is an issue that the community and its members frequently run into. I've seen easily dozens of independent realizations of this fact.</p><h3 id=toki-pona-taso-is-a-dead-end-ideology>"toki pona taso is a dead-end ideology"</h3><p>There is a reflex from especially skilled and invested speakers of Toki Pona to seriously over-correct, enforcing that only Toki Pona is used in specific environments or communities, as well as to discuss those environments or communities. It is their prerogative to do so, and I respect the effort- Toki Pona is capable of any conversation you need it for, and we should not artifically limit it out of a mistaken belief that Toki Pona <em>isn't</em> capable.</p><!-- ### Most conversations about toki pona do not change it --><!-- ## Realizations --><!-- ### Studying toki pona in English limits toki pona and you --><!-- ### Summary --><!-- ## My Advice --><h2 id=other-notes>Other notes</h2><h3 id=toki-pona-taso-is-a-dead-end-ideology-1>"toki pona taso is a dead-end ideology"</h3><p>This is a quote from jan Olipija, who happen to discuss this topic with jan Lakuse and jan Tepo a few days before I had a very similar conversation with kala Asi. It was pretty funny to find!</p><p>In reading, we're on a similar page about the challenges toki pona has faced in being its own language and having its own identity, but I don't fully agree with her diagnosis.</p><p>If I understood her correctly, her imagining of a future toki pona community is primarily bi-lingual</p><h3 id=arent-you-using-english-right-now>Aren't you using English right now?</h3><p>Yep!
