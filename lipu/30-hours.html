Nobody even knows how long it takes to learn all the words.</p><p>The community has been interested in this question for a long time, but no one has come up with any answer better than anecdotes. There <em>is</em> a notion that Toki Pona is "easier" to learn than natural languages, and even that it is the "easiest" language to learn. Odds are, neither of these can be tested, so they'll never be more than beliefs that some members of the community hold<a href=#fn1 class=footnote-ref id=fnref1 role=doc-noteref><sup>1</sup></a>.

It's a Toki Pona course made entirely of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis>comprehensible input</a>. He then asked prospective learners to take his 30 day challenge, where they would watch one of these videos every day for 30 days. At the end of the challenge, they'd hop on a call with jan Telakoman, discuss the challenge, and have a conversation in Toki Pona to put the course to the test.</p><p>Assuming participants follow the rules of the challenge, they will spend about 10 hours (20 minutes per video x 30 videos) studying Toki Pona over the course of 30 days. That's an excellent benchmark, and a very realistic timeline to become <em>conversational</em> in Toki Pona. So, has anyone done it?</p><p>Yes! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwYL9_SRAk8F1hpZqv-pTgtnAjtD4yAy5">This playlist</a>, with 14 videos as of writing, documents those who took the 30 day challenge and then recorded a talk with jan Telakoman. All of these videos feature a purely Toki Pona conversation, and most of those conversations are over ten minutes long. These conversations do have their fair share of struggles, but each person does successfully hold a fairly long conversation with jan Telakoman. Or, put another way, they have achieved a conversational level of Toki Pona.</p><p>With this, we can confidently claim that it takes at least <strong>10 hours</strong> over <strong>30 days</strong> to become <strong>conversational</strong> in Toki Pona.</p><p>And this claim is much more apt- in addition to the evidence behind it, it portrays the process of learning in a more sincere way. You can't brute-force your way through the learning process by doing everything up front. You need time to rest between lessons, so everything you've learned can "lock in"<a href=#fn4 class=footnote-ref id=fnref4 role=doc-noteref><sup>4</sup></a>. Put another way, most people aren't going to get 30 hours better at playing the piano if those 30 hours of practice are spread over only 3 days. Time spent is only part of the puzzle- consistency is another.</p><p>But if you'd prefer a snappier version of the claim:</p><h3 id=with-20-minutes-a-day-over-30-days-you-can-be-conversational-in-toki-pona>With <strong>20 minutes a day</strong> over <strong>30 days</strong>, you can be conversational in Toki Pona!</h3><p>But wait- <a href=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/07/toki-pona-smallest-language/398363/ >news organizations</a> and <a href=https://jalt-publications.org/sites/default/files/pdf-article/jalt2023-pcp-027.pdf>research publications</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_d6bGAw5yt8&amp;t=16s">youtubers</a> have been claiming it takes <strong>30 hours</strong> to learn Toki Pona <strong>since 2015</strong>, years before we had this evidence.

To do that, let's pick apart what "30 hours" means- not just literally, but as it would be understood by those reading it too.</p><h2 id=what-does-30-hours-mean>What does "30 hours" mean?</h2><p>As I've alluded to, the claim that "You can learn Toki Pona in 30 hours!" is misleading. The challenge is in understanding how it's misleading. The truth is, there was never a single number that correctly described how long it takes to learn Toki Pona, or any language.</p><p>The first number is the amount of time you spend immersed in or studying the language, the "study-hours" I've referred to. For example, you'll often see claims that learning Japanese takes <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/8pq4w9/how_long_to_learn_japanese/ >100 hours, or 325-600 hours, or 3000-4800 hours</a>, depending on what your goal is. This figure is generally given in hours.</p><p>The second number is how much time those study-hours are spread over. For example, you'll see claims that learning Japanese takes 6 months, or 1-2 years, or even sillier-sounding claims like "7 years" and "24 years." This figure is generally given in months or years, and is loosely linked to the study-hours figure by how many hours you spend studying per day.</p><p>But even understanding that the "30 hours" claim was missing context, there is still more missing context. The "30 hours" are study-hours, but what does "learn" mean? It could range from "knows the words" to "conversational" to "fluent," and even "fluency" can be understood differently from person to person. When the 30 hour claim was first made on the forum, "learn" was quoted to indicate its dubious meaning- "learn" could have meant "become conversational" or even as little as "make some sentences." Either way, these are wildly different from the "mastery" or "fluency" claim that appears in so many articles.</p><p>When the "30 hours" claim appears in various publications, especially after the Atlantic article, there doesn't seem to be any care taken for how the reader would interpret the claim. There is no context given for those 30 hours. The articles do not specify how long you might take to get through those 30 hours, and they provide either no understanding or a badly misinformed understanding of what you'll achieve by the end of those 30 hours.</p><p>This issue is made even worse by the fact that Toki Pona is a "small" language, or "minimalist" language, or "the world's smallest" language. These, while mostly accurate on their own, make the 30 hour claim even more misleading by adding legitimacy to the "30 hours to fluency" claim. If the language is so small, it makes perfect sense that you can learn it so fast! Except that isn't true at all.</p><p>It would have been more <em>honest</em> to say that those 30 hours were over the course of a few weeks or months, or at least that they were 30 hours of studying. But many publications let readers come away with the belief that "you can learn Toki Pona in 30 hours," where the reader will likely understand "30 hours" as "basically two days."</p><p>The only solution to this is to include all the context you can, every time you make this claim. At minimum:</p><ul><li>It takes at least 10 hours of study over 30 days, structured as 20 minutes per day.</li><li>There's only one learning method, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwYL9_SRAk8EXSZPSTm9lm2kD_Z1RzUgm">comprehensible input</a>, that is known to work in that time frame.</li><li>You'll only get to a "conversational" level of Toki Pona with this amount of time and effort.</li><li>Your personal results could be different!</li></ul><p>And if you must put flashy numbers on how long it takes to learn Toki Pona, "conversational in 10 hours over 30 days" or "20 minutes per day for 30 days to be conversational" is as good as it's going to get.</p><!--

## How did I find this out?

In short: Working backwards! The rest of this article is a discussion of the research.
If all you wanted was the answer to the question in the title, you're good to go!

Sonja recently posted [that specific research publication](https://jalt-publications.org/sites/default/files/pdf-article/jalt2023-pcp-027.pdf), which follows a small group of Japanese students and professors as they learned Toki Pona. About two minutes into reading it, I got smacked in the face by this classic bit of misinformation:

> It is generally said to take only 30 hours to learn (Yuzbay, 2023).

Does following that trail lead us anywhere useful?

Following that citation brings you to [this Medium article by Elvira Yuzbay](https://elvirayuzbay.medium.com/how-much-can-you-say-with-137-words-18e80d47fbb), published January 27th 2023:

> It is estimated that it takes roughly 30 hours to master the language.

But she didn't provide any citation, so the trail immediately runs cold. Oops. But naturally,
we can [google](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_(verb)>) it.

Googling [toki pona "30 hours"](https://www.google.com/search?q=toki+pona+%2230+hours%22) takes you to several more uncited sources, such as [this reddit comment from 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/tokipona/comments/o3zgf5/hi_im_new_to_toki_pona_and_im_curious_about_how/h2evvhx/) and [this one from 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/tokipona/comments/5f0jzy/how_long_did_toki_pona_take_you_to_learn/ddxn7tw/).

> IIRC I saw the figure 30 hours for intermediate level reading and writing somewhere.

> The average time is around 30 hours or so I hear

You'll note that both of these comments make the same 30 hour claim with differing levels of certainty. I should stress: This is the sort of information that, if it had a source, would be trivial to search for and post a link to. I'd go even further and claim that, if such a study existed, Toki Pona would be in the news way more often.

Let's go further, then:

[June 27th 2017 in Jagran Josh](https://www.jagranjosh.com/general-knowledge/do-you-know-about-worlds-smallest-language-1498569438-1), which appears to be a news organization but named after and run by one person?:

> but speakers of the "Toki Pona" language believe that it takes only 30 hours to master this language.

No citation.

[February 25th 2016 in Scoop Whoop](https://www.scoopwhoop.com/language/toki-pona-worlds-smallest-language/) (warning: all the suggested articles are NSFW):

This one attributes the claim to Sonja Lang (and directly links her personal facebook
profile???? what???????), but doesn't specify where she supposedly made that claim.

[November 19th 2015 in The Allusionist](https://www.theallusionist.org/transcripts/tokipona):

> apparently you can become fluent in it with around 30 hours’ study.

This is a transcript of an interview with Sonja. You'd think that, if she made the 30
hour claim, it would be here? But nope, the interviewer says it, and Sonja doesn't say
anything about it.

[July 20th 2015 in Mental Floss](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/66403/language-only-123-words-less-more):

This one has a citation to [this January 8th 2015 article in The Guardian] linked on the
phrase "around 30 hours", but that article does not make the specific 30 hour claim at all! And to be sure, [it hasn't been edited since its publication](https://web.archive.org/web/20150108222332/https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jan/08/toki-pona-invented-language-memrise).

I will grant, this article does indirectly claim you can make sentences and communicate by your second day of speaking Toki Pona. Honestly, that's probably true

> a general consensus among Toki Pona speakers is that it takes about 30 hours to master.

Before we continue, I need note

as an aside: there are genuinely dozens of other news articles which parrot the same "general consensus" and "30 hours" data points. searching "toki pona" "30 hours" will show you articles from mental floss, the allusionist, that same atlantic article, a podcast called "this is criminal"

but the earliest source i can find is [here on the toki pona forum in january 2011](http://forums.tokipona.org/viewtopic.php?p=9984&hilit=about%2030%20hours#p9984)

> I spent on average, about 45 minutes per day studying toki pona, so that means it took me about 30 hours to 'learn' toki pona. (I was never any good at learning languages!)

the interesting thing about the comment is that the 30 hours is not portrayed as "30 hours from introduction to understanding" as the "30 hours" bit tends to be read, but instead as 30 hours _studying_! which, for achieving a basic level of conversational, might be achievable! like, my course and jan Telakoman's course combined are shorter than that, and telakoman has literal proof of the effectiveness of his course in several videos with those who took the 30 day challenge.

but i think [_this_ is the original source](http://forums.tokipona.org/viewtopic.php?p=11117&hilit=30%20hours%20according%20survey#p11117)

> You can learn all there is in about 30 hours of study (according to the survey on the forum)
> jan Mato references a "survey on the forum" which, if i'm not mistaken, is their own thread that i linked above in which... exactly one person said it took them 30 hours of study.

Although, it may be that they're referencing the [handful](http://forums.tokipona.org/viewtopic.php?p=10421&hilit=hours%20study#p10421) of [times](http://forums.tokipona.org/viewtopic.php?p=11337&hilit=hours%20study#p11337) they asked people too?

But they referenced the 30 hours bit [here in June 2011](http://forums.tokipona.org/viewtopic.php?p=10777&hilit=30%20hours#p10777), so I'm genuinely not sure!

In summary, uhh, one guy said it took him 30 hours to learn toki pona, jan Mato took that super seriously without much further evidence, and at some point news organizations began laundering that up to the point of being fact. Cynically, I'd assume whichever one of those previously mentioned news organizations just googled "How long does it take to learn toki pona" and found the exact posts by jan Mato that I was looking at, but didn't care to look any closer.
