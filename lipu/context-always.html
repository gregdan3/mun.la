To my experience, it's more likely that somebody will offer me a whole apple than either slices or multiple apples when they say "Want some fruit?" This assumption of reasonability is critical to making toki pona usable- it's an argument about averages, rather than a statement about possibility (which is also why I noted in my original statement that I wasn't arguing against the essay's premise, just observing. It's also not a disagreement, more a note about how the presense/absence of information shapes understanding)</p><p>That said, I <em>don't</em> disagree. The above has been my tested experience for the entire time I've spoken Toki Pona- I don't see value in undermining this thought process just because something different is possible :sweat_smile: If something different from my assumptions/experiences occurs, context will inform that. The rest of the time, my assumptions are practical and effective- and while I haven't much examined English in this same lens, I imagine I do the same there without thought?</p><p>Otherwise, the "lili kili" example is good as a counterpoint- I hadn't used lili in that way before [like kipisi], so I'll probably adopt that</p><p>Here's a short version of this: Toki Pona words do not mark time or number, but this does not mean their use <em>is</em> arbitrarily large/complex. It means their use <em>can be</em> arbitrarily large/complex. Far more often than not, their uses <em>aren't</em> in these extremes. They're average cases with reasonably sized meanings/outcomes, because that's the majority of what we deal with day to day.</p></div><div class=footer><h2 class=tp lang=tok>o toki tawa mi</h2><p><a href=https://youtube.com/@gregdan3d><img src=/buttons/youtube_s.gif alt="@gregdan3d on YouTube"class=button> </a><a href=https://github.com/gregdan3><img src=/buttons/github_s.gif alt="@gregdan3 on GitHub"class=button> </a><a href=https://discord.com/users/497549183847497739><img src=/buttons/discord_s.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Discord"class=button> </a><a href=https://gregdan3.t.me/ ><img src=/buttons/telegram_s.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Telegram"class=button></a></p></div><script src=/sptoggle.js></script><script data-goatcounter=https://jankekansan.goatcounter.com/count async src=//gc.zgo.at/count.js></script></div></html>
