I&rsquo;m writing this preface months later, and choosing to put this out there knowing it doesn&rsquo;t reflect who I am now. But I am not far removed from these problems. I still feel them, and for those problems that are gone, I still feel their effects. But, in reading over this, I felt it was too important to not put out there. If you want to know how I&rsquo;m doing now, read <a href=./to-help-yourself.html>To Help Yourself</a> that I thought deeply about and put to writing days after writing this.</p> <p>But so we&rsquo;re clear: I feel passion for my work again. I am excited for my future. I am enjoying my hobbies. And I am fighting for myself. These feelings are fragile, and I don&rsquo;t know what direction they are taking me. But I am better now for the effort I have put into myself.</p> <hr> <p>I feel like I no longer have the energy to <em>be</em> on a daily basis.</p> <p>I get up. Go for a walk. Do some sets of pullups. Eat breakfast most days. Shower. Get some hobby work done. Sure, that&rsquo;s all fine, and it&rsquo;s never upset me. Some of these are slower than I&rsquo;d like, but nothing wrong so far.</p> <p>When I get into work, I feel like I bang my head against problems that should be simple, or at least simpler, for me to solve. I feel like I&rsquo;m wasting my hours on misunderstandings I shouldn&rsquo;t have, problems that shouldn&rsquo;t be hard to solve, documentation that should be easy to write. My work used to be satisfying to me. Challenging in a fair way. Productive in a meaningful way. Somehow I can&rsquo;t find any of these anymore.</p> <p>When I get into conversations, I find I repeat myself more than I used to. I can&rsquo;t get out sentences properly a bit too often. I take longer to think about what I want to say, and still make all these mistakes. I forget conversations and happenings that were yesterday.</p> <p>I&rsquo;m describing the symptoms of depression. These are symptoms of depression.</p> <p>I don&rsquo;t think there is any time nor any place where I can speak about the problems I&rsquo;ve been having with my mental health. Doing so at work is a non-starter, but nonetheless these issues negatively affects my work. I can&rsquo;t talk about my issues when hanging out with friends either, because that&rsquo;s supposed to be time for hanging out, for having a good time. I vent when I&rsquo;m alone, but it doesn&rsquo;t make any difference.</p> <p>I don&rsquo;t know how to be more proactive about helping myself, either.</p> <p>I spend all the time I need taking care of myself. I get plenty of exercise. I&rsquo;m eating better now than I have in the rest of my life. I&rsquo;m losing weight, and building muscle. Physically, these changes feel fantastic. The progress I&rsquo;ve made feels unreal. And of course, I&rsquo;ve been conscious not to over-work myself physically. No trouble there.</p> <p>I also spend the time I want to exploring my hobbies and interests, and otherwise treat my mind right. I&rsquo;ve made time to play games, new ones and ones I already love. Spent time to relax. Made time and space to meditate. Developed new skills, and made time to improve at skills I already had. Written music. Written useful software, even if for myself.</p> <p>And I&rsquo;ve done a bit of these together! Hiking is a fantastic way to get your mind and body working toward the same goal.</p> <p>I&rsquo;ve tried a pretty wide variety of other management strategies too. Some of what I&rsquo;ve already listed are quality distractions. I mentioned meditation already. I tried therapy for a time- I&rsquo;m still looking for a different therapist, as my last set of sessions ended under the unfortunate circumstance of surprising me with extra expenses. Taking suggestions!</p> <p>But every single one of these, and more that I haven&rsquo;t listed, have a critical commonality: I&rsquo;m doing them all alone. I am spending time on each of these alone.</p> <p>Being alone is one thing. Being lonely is another. And brother, I feel brutally lonely. I want to stop coming home to my apartment and there be nothing but me there. I want to stop going out in public and struggling to find a person interested in talking, I&rsquo;d like to talk to someone. I want to sit down with somebody interesting and hear every word they have to say on what excites and fascinates them. And I&rsquo;d love to share everything that&rsquo;s exciting to me with somebody who&rsquo;ll listen.</p> <p>Those aren&rsquo;t changing. That could be my fault. I could be doing something wrong. And I wouldn&rsquo;t have any way of knowing, would I? All I can do is hope that I&rsquo;m not ruining everything for myself.</p> <p>I feel that the best help would be to spend time with my friends. Have some hugs. Talk about some feelings, but in a good, healthy way. And you know what? There&rsquo;s friends I&rsquo;d love to sit and nerd out with. Explore some cool new places or ideas with.</p> <p>But I&rsquo;m in horrible mental shape. Spending time with my friends under that circumstance would put undue stress on my friends, who have to deal with the fact that I&rsquo;m not at full mental strength or capacity, who would have to carry my emotional weight. Or I can try keep it to myself and not talk about it. Even in trying to do this, people notice that I&rsquo;m not myself. And why wouldn&rsquo;t they? I&rsquo;m not upbeat. Not cheery. Not functioning like a human is supposed to. I can&rsquo;t get out of my own head. I can&rsquo;t stop having this miserable look on my face, and I hate when I&rsquo;m noticed for that! I want to feel like I can be in a social situation without dragging others down, or needing to stop to have my mental issues tended to. I want to be able to be in a situation and <em>be in it</em>.</p> <p>Am I sabotaging myself and not realizing it? Am I not doing enough to help myself? Is there some behavior I have that&rsquo;s causing me to be unhappy when I have no good reason to be? Is there something I&rsquo;m exposing myself to that&rsquo;s causing me to be miserable?</p> <p>Is it reasonable to feel this way?</p> <p>Please stop noticing that something is wrong with me. I already know.</p> </article> <footer> <p>Licensed under <a href=/LICENSE.txt>GPLv3</a>.</p> <p> Code on <a href=https://github.com/gregdan3/gregdan3.github.io>my GitHub</a>. </p> </footer> <script data-goatcounter=https://gregdan3.goatcounter.com/count async src=//gc.zgo.at/count.js></script> </body> </html>
