### Maybe Some Day

</summary>

- I finished a translation of Zulf's Theme from Bastion, and am doing my best to record it!
  - Every time I want to sing, I get some sort of throat infection, so eeeee

### Finished

</summary>

This is in most to least recent order.

- I created a pair of videos for suno pi toki pona, [one in toki pona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgkDx8dIAio) and [one in a weird version of English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_awfcwuJhpk).
- I put out a video with a toki pona taso section, all about the variety of ways you can describe a jellyfish! [See it here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ituR4S-NS0)
- I made a bot to run tenpo pi toki pona taso events in ma pona pi toki pona, and it grew into a full ilo pi toki pona taso!
- I did some AWESOME april fools gags [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywy9Fa8wcOI) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxe0cHuSBG4), as well as turning ma pona pi toki pona into ma Losupan pi toki Losupan!
- I recorded and edited my multiple li/e, en, anu lesson, [check it out!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGsodPu9UAw)
- I did a walkthrough translation lesson! [Check it out!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeQAKIIIjBA)
- I did a live VR lesson on [la]{.tokipona}! [Lesson here!](/sona/la.html)
- I dubbed waso mu's comic ["mi lon e ma"](https://waso-mu.neocities.org/musi/), [see it here!](https://youtu.be/GU9PEZ9TARs)
- I'm posting my names, numbers, kin lesson on February 3rd!
- I'm writing my [lesson on la](/sona/la.html) and adding more to my [extras lesson](/sona/bits.html)!
  - Fun fact: I didn't introduce multiple li/e early in my video lessons, so I have to do an extras lesson on them. Oops! I'll be doing en/anu at the same time though!
- I played through the first part of waso Keli's translation of Link's Awakening! [See it here](https://youtu.be/xi8gUvqyMm4)!
- I wrote an article on Simulation Theory for [lipu tenpo](https://liputenpo.org/).
- I'm editing my Interjections lesson for YouTube! [o kama sona!](https://youtube.com/@gregdan3d)
  - This is stuck a bit because I am figuring out how to best do an end card. Everything is done except for one voice line and that graphic.
- I wrote an article on simulation theory and threw it to a few others.
- I'm cleaning up my new site, <https://mun.la>, that split from <https://gregdan3.dev>!
  - While I'm doing that, I'm making sure I don't cause any link rot. Keep the internet alive!
