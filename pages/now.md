- I'm editing my Interjections lesson for YouTube! [o kama sona!](https://youtube.com/@gregdan3d)
- I'm also editing a mini lesson on names, numbers, and the function of kin!
- I'm writing my [lesson on la](/sona/la.html) and adding more to my [extras lesson](/sona/bits.html)!
  - Fun fact: because I didn't introduce multiple li/e early on in my video lessons, I have to do an extras lesson on them. Oops!
- I'm cleaning up my new site, <https://mun.la>, that split from <https://gregdan3.com>!
  - While I'm doing that, I'm making sure I don't cause any link rot. Keep the internet alive!
