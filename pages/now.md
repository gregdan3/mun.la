- I'm writing another article for [lipu tenpo](https://liputenpo.org/)!
  - Running is great!
- I'm editing a mini lesson on names, numbers, and the function of kin!
- I'm writing my [lesson on la](/sona/la.html) and adding more to my [extras lesson](/sona/bits.html)!
  - Fun fact: I didn't introduce multiple li/e early in my video lessons, so I have to do an extras lesson on them. Oops! I'll be doing en/anu at the same time though!

## Waiting

- I finished a translation of Zulf's Theme from Bastion, and am doing my best to record it!
  - Every time I want to sing, I get some sort of throat infection, so eeeee

## Finished

This is in most to least recent order.

- I played through the first part of waso Keli's translation of Link's Awakening! [See it here](https://youtu.be/xi8gUvqyMm4)!
- I wrote an article on Simulation Theory for [lipu tenpo](https://liputenpo.org/).
- I'm editing my Interjections lesson for YouTube! [o kama sona!](https://youtube.com/@gregdan3d)
  - This is stuck a bit because I am figuring out how to best do an end card. Everything is done except for one voice line and that graphic.
- I wrote an article on simulation theory and threw it to a few others.
- I'm cleaning up my new site, <https://mun.la>, that split from <https://gregdan3.dev>!
  - While I'm doing that, I'm making sure I don't cause any link rot. Keep the internet alive!
