## Overview

The word "preposition" comes from these words marking times and place- the "pre" part is for the fact that these words come before positions.

Prepositions add context to a sentence. When using a preposition, you say the word and a phrase following it- the phrase is the context, and the word tells you what kind of context it is!

::: info

Focus on **where the preposition is** in the next few sentences!

:::

A preposition may appear after the object:

> [suno li walo e kiwen <u>**tawa lukin**</u>]{.tokipona}

After the predicate, without an object:

> [kasi li kama wawa <u>**tan telo pona**</u>]{.tokipona}

Or right after [li]{.tokipona} as the predicate:

> [ona li <u>**sama mi mute**</u>]{.tokipona}

Prepositions appear **last** in a statement. Keep that in mind!

#### Every Preposition

---

##### tawa

[tawa]{.tokipona} is all about context, so watch carefully!

[tawa]{.tokipona} can describe moving toward a specific place or thing:

<details><summary> [mi <u>**tawa telo suli**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

I'm traveling **to the ocean**!

</details>

<details><summary> [ona li pana e sona <u>**tawa jan ante**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

They gave knowledge **to different people**.

</details>

[tawa]{.tokipona} can describe perspective, like English "to": description from the point of view of something or someone!

<details><summary> [ni li pona mute <u>**tawa mi**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

This is fantastic **to me**!

This is so good **in my opinion**!

</details>

<details><summary> [kasi ni li suli <u>**tawa jan**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

This plant is huge **to people**!

This plant is huge **compared to people**!

</details>

And [tawa]{.tokipona} can describe purpose, like English "for": doing an action on something or someone's behalf.

<details><summary> [jan li pali e ni <u>**tawa sona**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

The person created this **for understanding**!

</details>

<details><summary> [mi ni <u>**tawa ona**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

I did this **for them**.

</details>

You can tell these different uses of [tawa]{.tokipona} apart by context. For example, if the speaker is explaining why they did something, that would be about purpose. Or, if the speaker is giving their opinion, that would be about perspective. You'll get used to these different ideas as you practice!

---

##### lon

[lon]{.tokipona} is used for location, telling where or when something is!

This can be a place:

<details><summary> [kulupu li <u>**lon kiwen walo jelo**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

The group is **on the rocks that are yellow and white**!

</details>

It can also be about time, when or for how long something happens.
This uses one new word besides [lon]{.tokipona}, [tenpo]{.tokipona}:

<details><summary> [suno li <u>**lon tenpo suli**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

The sun has existed **for a long time**.

It will be sunny **for a long time**!

</details>

And it can be about ideas, like subjects in a conversation:

<details><summary> [mi toki <u>**lon sona alasa mi**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

I am talking **about my hunting knowledge**!

I am talking **about my searching knowledge**.

</details>

All of these are different kinds of locations. Try lots of things out!

---

##### tan

[tan]{.tokipona} talks about the cause or origin of something. It is similar to "from" or "because of" in English.

<details><summary> [mi wawa <u>**tan moku pona**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

I'm strong because of good food!

</details>

This can describe some kinds of motion, or just be explanatory:

<details><summary> [mi <u>**tan kulupu musi**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

I'm from a comedy troupe!

I got here from the improv group.

</details>

::: warning

Remember: [tawa]{.tokipona} talks about purpose, while [tan]{.tokipona} talks about cause. To tell them apart, ask yourself: is one making the other happen? If so, that's [tan]{.tokipona}!

:::

---

##### sama

[sama]{.tokipona} talks about the similarity of things. This may be to compare the subject to something:

<details><summary> [pali sona sina li <u>**sama pali pi mama mi**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

Your teaching job is the same as my dad's job!

Your programming work is the same as my mom's work!

</details>

Or to compare the subject's action to something:

<details><summary> [ona li ken tawa wawa <u>**sama jan wawa**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

They can move quickly, like a sprinter!

They can move powerfully, like a weight-lifter!

</details>

[sama]{.tokipona} covers all kinds of sameness- a little similar, identical, and everything between!

---

##### kepeken

<details><summary> [jan li seli e moku <u>**kepeken ilo seli**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

The person is cooking the food **using a heating tool**.

</details>

[kepeken]{.tokipona} means "to use". The thing in a [kepeken]{.tokipona} prep phrase is being used by the subject. That's it!

---

Now that we've covered all the prepositions, here are some important notes about using them!

#### Multiple prepositions

When a prepositional phrase is complete, you can start another one. You can do this as many times as you want, but fewer is clearer. Some examples:

<details><summary> [ona li kama jo e pan suwi <u>**tan jan pi pali moku**</u>, <u>**tawa pilin pona**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

They received some cake **from a baker**, **to feel better**

</details>

<details><summary> [ona li toki <u>**lon lape ona**</u>, <u>**sama mama pi jan mi**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

They talk **in their sleep**, **same as my partner's dad!**

They talk **when napping**, **like my friend's mom!**

</details>

<details><summary> [pilin mi li kama pona <u>**tan lape**</u>, <u>**tan tawa telo**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

My feelings have gotten better **from sleeping** and **from swimming**.

</details>

Otherwise, the rules are the same as with just one preposition!

::: warning

The commas are present to separate the two prepositions. They aren't needed- just helpful!

:::

#### ala and prepositions

You can negate prepositions by putting [ala]{.tokipona} after the preposition.

<details><summary> [kiwen suno li <u>**tawa ala mi**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

The shiny rock is **not for me**!

</details>

<details><summary> [jan pali li <u>**kepeken ala lipu ni**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

The workers are **not using this document**!

</details>

<details><summary> [mi pilin nasa <u>**sama ala sina**</u>]{.tokipona} </summary>

I'm feeling weird, **unlike you**.

::: info

This sentence doesn't clarify _which_ thing is not similar- and that's okay!

:::

</details>

This is so simple, you already got it!

::: info

Stick to negating **predicates**, **modifiers**, **pre-predicates**, or **prepositions**. Clean and clear!

:::

<details><summary>A note about [ala]{.tokipona} with other things</summary>

Negating the subject ([jan ala li ...]{.tokipona}) and negating the prepositional phrase ([... tan sona ala]{.tokipona}) can give you a similar result to negating the preposition. **_Can_**.

Most of the time, it makes things confusing! What does it mean when [jan ala li kepeken sona]{.tokipona}? Or when [mi tawa musi sama sina ala]{.tokipona}?

The first is something like "Not-people" or "Non-persons" use knowledge. And the second is "I dance the same way as not-you." These are confusing!

## Exercises

### Toki Pona to English

#### One Preposition

You're walking through a convention center, when somebody runs up and says hi! They know you from your outreach work, and are excited to meet you. They open up with:

<details><summary> [sina tan kulupu pi jan pana]{.tokipona} </summary>

You're from the philanthropy community!

</details>

You're on a tour of a factory, watching how various household objects get made. As you walk, you observe marvelous machinery working hard- and then come across one machine in particular wielding another machine! You remark:

<details><summary> [ilo li pali e supa kepeken ilo ante]{.tokipona} </summary>

The machine is creating furniture using other machines!

</details>

You have been using a new studying method for school work. The way it helps you dig through material is clear and concise, and you always feel like you have a good grasp on the concepts after. You recommend it to others, saying:

<details><summary> [nasin sona ni li pona tawa sona jan]{.tokipona} </summary>

This learning method is great for people's understanding.

</details>

Every time you try to take a vacation, something comes up and you have to cancel. It's like the universe is conspiring against you. You've been planning a trip to the Bahamas for months, but your boss said you can't take the time off. You're starting to think they're doing it on purpose. You think to yourself:

<details><summary> [mi pali lon tenpo mute・mi wile tawa ma ante]{.tokipona} </summary>

I work too much. I want to go somewhere different!

</details>

Your friend has been reading somebody's blog, and feeding you hints as to its topic as they go. You're not sure what it's about, and your friend won't tell you no matter how much you ask! Until one day, barely stifling a chuckle, they tell you:

<details><summary> [ma li supa sama supa moku]{.tokipona} </summary>

The earth is flat like a dinner plate!

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_DfpQTRvyc>

</details>

Your teacher is emphasizing the relative size of the earth in comparison to other objects. This is an important idea for students to understand, because it helps them to put the earth's size into perspective. It also helps them to understand that the earth is a huge object, and that it is much larger than any one person. Your teacher says:

<details><summary> [ma li suli ala tawa sewi・ona li suli tawa jan]{.tokipona} </summary>

The earth isn't large compared to the sky. It's large compared to people.

</details>

#### Multiple Prepositions

You're back home again, feeling great because of your trip, but there's one thing wrong: you have a limp! You're in too good a mood to let it get you down, but one of your friends asked what happened. You explain:

<details><summary> [mi pilin ike tan tawa anpa lon tenpo poka]{.tokipona} </summary>

I'm feeling bad because I fell down recently.

</details>

A close friend is going on a long trip, and doesn't know when they'll be back. They gave you something important to them- a bracelet they'd had for years. You try to refuse it, saying it's too important to them to give away. But your friend insists, saying:

<details><summary> [mi pana e ni tawa sina tan wile mi]{.tokipona} </summary>

I'm giving this to you because I wanted to.

</details>

After quitting your job, you find yourself with brand new freedom. You cut down your expenses, sell some stuff, and start traveling with the saved money. When you get to your first destination, you realize something even better with great excitement! In a shocked, hushed tone you say:

<details><summary> [mi ken lon ma ale lon tenpo ale]{.tokipona} </summary>

I can be in any place, at any time!

</details>

#### ala and Prepositions

You're sitting in class, learning about how plants have adapted to a variety of different environments. However, there are some environments that plants haven't adapted to, such as the cold and thin air on tall mountains! The teacher says:

<details><summary> [kasi li lon ala ma sewi]{.tokipona} </summary>

Plants aren't on ground that is way high up!

</details>

There's a storm, and the wind is whipping past you at an alarming speed! As the storm comes in, the wind picks up ferociously, blowing the plants and the trees around. As you watch, you notice the shrubs and grasses being blown over without resistance, then rising back up. But the trees have their branches torn away. You remark:

<details><summary> [kasi lili li sama ala kasi suli]{.tokipona} </summary>

The shrubs and grasses are not similar to the trees.

</details>

You're having a discussion with some friends about where you grew up, and how that influenced the way you think. For many of them, their life philosophies came from where they grew up, but you feel differently and say:

<details><summary> [nasin mi li tan ala ma mi]{.tokipona} </summary>

My philosophy is not from where I was born!

</details>

You're trekking through a desert with a guide, stopping rest through the night. Your guide explains that you need to bundle up: the temperature of the desert depends on the sun, so the desert will become freezing when the sun sets. You ask a follow-up question: if it gets cold enough, will there be ice? And the guide explains:

<details><summary> [kiwen lete li lon ala ma ni tan ni・telo li lon ala]{.tokipona} </summary>

There is no ice here because of this: there is no water.

</details>

<!-- TODO: more examples -->

### English to Toki Pona

<details><summary> Everyone is on the road. They're heading to the cool caves! </summary>

[jan ale li lon nasin・ona li tawa ma anpa pona]{.tokipona}

[jan ale li tawa nasin・ona li tawa ma anpa pona]{.tokipona}

[jan ale li tawa ma anpa pona]{.tokipona}

</details>

<details><summary> You can look at the gravel on the mountain from here! </summary>

[sina ken lukin e ma lon ma sewi tan ma ni]{.tokipona}

[sina ken lukin e ko lon ma sewi tan ma ni]{.tokipona}

[sina ken lukin e kiwen lili mute lon ma sewi tan ma ni]{.tokipona}

</details>

<details><summary> I'm sitting in a pretty chair. </summary>

[mi lon supa pona]{.tokipona}

[mi awen lon supa ni・ona li pona tawa lukin]{.tokipona}

</details>

<details><summary> **I'm giving this to my brother for your sake.**  </summary>

[mi pana e ni tawa jan poka mi・ni li tawa sina]{.tokipona}

::: info

In this case, using the [tawa]{.tokipona} preposition twice is confusing, since it could mean another person getting something from [pana]{.tokipona}! The second use of it is moved to a separate sentence.

:::

</details>

<details><summary> My books are on a big bookshelf! </summary>

[lipu mi li lon supa suli]{.tokipona}

[lipu mi li lon supa suli lipu]{.tokipona}

</details>

<details><summary> My books fell off my bookshelf... </summary>

[lipu mi li tawa anpa tan supa mi]{.tokipona}

</details>

<!-- TODO: more examples -->

## Takeaway

#### Grammar

Prepositions extend the grammar once more! You can now include a new phrase in your sentences, which occurs in the predicate, after the predicate, or after the object- last in the statement. Here are some examples of this idea:

> [subject] ([li]{.tokipona}) (preposition [prep phrase])

> [subject] ([li]{.tokipona}) [predicate] (preposition [prep phrase])

> [subject] ([li]{.tokipona}) [predicate] ([e]{.tokipona} [object]) (preposition [prep phrase])

Keep in mind: if a preposition comes right after [li]{.tokipona} it's still the predicate!

#### New Ambiguity

You may have noticed during the lesson that the word [tawa]{.tokipona} is used often as a normal content word and as a preposition. It gets modified often too. Telling [tawa]{.tokipona} preposition apart from [tawa]{.tokipona} as a content word can be difficult!

Toki Pona doesn't have a way of telling apart modified [tawa]{.tokipona} from [tawa]{.tokipona} preposition. But the two can be told apart easily, especially as you practice. [tawa]{.tokipona} near the end of the sentence, and especially after an object, is a preposition more often than not. [tawa]{.tokipona} in the predicate is generally a modifier.

This applies to every preposition, but understandably, it affects [tawa]{.tokipona} the most. If you're ever unsure, ask somebody for help with reading, or ask for a restatement when speaking!
