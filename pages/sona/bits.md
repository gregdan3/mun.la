## Overview

This lesson is a big collection of quickly explained but unrelated ideas, to fill out some important details about using the language!

### Proper Names

#### nasin pona

In Toki Pona, you can refer to things by their name. To do this, you start with describing the thing. What kind of thing is this? Languages are [toki]{.tokipona}, games are [musi]{.tokipona}, and people are usually [jan]{.tokipona}! Then you can use the name right after, like a modifier.

<details><summary> mi lon ma Kanse! </summary>

I'm in France!

</details>

When written in latin characters, proper names are always capitalized at the start.

<details><summary> [mi lon ma [kiwen alasa nasin sewi esun]]{.tokipona} </summary>

I'm in France!

</details>

In [sitelen pona]{.tokipona}, proper names are written in a box, then spelled by reading the first letter of each symbol in the box. Here we spell out **Kanse**, which is what France is called in Toki Pona!

Here's a quick exchange between two people who have newly met!

> [mi jan [kepeken ilo mute ike]]{.tokipona}!
>
> > [nimi sina li suwi! mi jan [alasa jan ante]]{.tokipona}!

The first speaker's name is **Kimi**, and the second is **Aja**!

::: info

Toki Pona lets people and places name themselves! For example, Japan is called "にほん (Nihon)" by Japanese speakers, so in Toki Pona, Japan is called **ma Nijon**.

:::

#### sitelen kalama

There is a fancier way of writing names, known as [sitelen kalama]{.tokipona}. It works with the system described above, so you can do both at once!

To start, this system uses **morae**. Morae are like syllables, but they only go up to the vowel of a syllable, because the "n" that comes at the end of a syllable is a whole mora! Some examples:

- In **sitelen**, the syllables are **si** **te** **len**, but the morae are **si** **te** **le** **n**.
- Similarly, in **nanpa** the syllables are **nan** **pa**, but the morae are **na** **n** **pa**!

Using mora, we can write names in a new way! Without a dot, [[kepeken]]{.tokipona} is read as just **k**, but each dot completes the next mora:

- [[kepeken·]]{.tokipona} is **ke**, finishing the **ke** mora!
- [[kepeken··]]{.tokipona} is **kepe**, adding a whole mora!
- [[kepeken···]]{.tokipona} is **kepeke**, one more mora!
- [[kepeken····]]{.tokipona} is the entire word **kepeken**!

If the way the word is normally read is already a full mora, you go onto the next one still. This applies to words that start with vowels, because vowels are also complete mora! Examples with [anpa]{.tokipona}:

- [[anpa]]{.tokipona} is **a** as you usually read it
- [[anpa·]]{.tokipona} is **an**, which is two morae: **a** and **n**
- [[anpa··]]{.tokipona} is **anpa**, now the entire word!

And then with [ike]{.tokipona}:

- [[ike]]{.tokipona} is **i** without any dots
- [[ike·]]{.tokipona} is **ike**, which is two morae: **i** and **ke**

If you want to use a whole word, but you don't want lots of dots, you can use a colon [[:]]{.tokipona} to refer to the entire word! [[kepeken:]]{.tokipona} is read as the whole word **kepeken**, the same as [[kepeken····]]{.tokipona} above.

Finally, here's somebody named **Kawalo** introducing themselves, and somebody named **Seta Luki** responding, written in this system:

> [toki! mi jan [kala· walo:]]{.tokipona}
>
> > [toki a, jan [kala· walo:] o! mi jan [sewi· tawa·] [lukin··]]{.tokipona}

---

No matter how you write them, names aren't set in stone in Toki Pona. Different speakers will use somewhat different names for the same places and things, and that's okay! It's the same as describing the same thing two different ways- something we do in Toki Pona often!

For your own name, just pick something you love!

### Numbers

#### nasin pona

::: info

Toki Pona has numbers, but they aren't important! If there are lots of things, use [mute]{.tokipona}. If there are a few things, try [mute lili]{.tokipona}, or nothing at all! Numbers aren't important in Toki Pona.

:::

Toki Pona has two numbers: [wan]{.tokipona} and [tu]{.tokipona}. Their names sound like the same numbers from English: one (1) and two (2).

<details><summary> [o kama jo e ilo tu wan]{.tokipona} </summary>

Pick up three (3, 2+1) tools.

Go get three (3, 2+1) tools.

</details>

When counting things, you use numbers as modifiers. So in this example, [tu wan]{.tokipona} is like having a modifier that means "three."

[wan]{.tokipona} is one, [tu]{.tokipona} is two, [tu wan]{.tokipona} is three, [tu tu]{.tokipona} is four, and [tu tu wan]{.tokipona} is five. This keeps going, which gets long quickly! Try [mute]{.tokipona} instead of a bunch of [tu]{.tokipona} and [wan]{.tokipona}.

By the way: [wan]{.tokipona} and [tu]{.tokipona} are normal content words with meanings besides numbers:

<details><summary> [mi wan e lipu ale]{.tokipona} </summary>

I combined all the papers.

I united all the documents.

</details>

<details><summary> [soweli li tu e moku tawa pana]{.tokipona} </summary>

The animal divided up the food to gift.

The critter split up the food to give away.

</details>

You can also use the word [nanpa]{.tokipona} to rank things. [nanpa wan]{.tokipona} is often used to refer to favorites, like this:

<details><summary> [ni li pona nanpa wan tawa mi]{.tokipona} </summary>

This is my favorite!

This is the best good thing, to me!

</details>

For this, [nanpa]{.tokipona} works like [pi]{.tokipona} because it groups the words after it into one modifier- even if there is only one word after it! The new modifier is a rank, like "first" or "third."

#### nasin suli

If you _really, really_ want to use bigger and more specific numbers, there is a system with more numbers than one and two.

Counting with this system works exactly as before, except you have bigger numbers to use:

::: tpdefinitions

| Word                                      | Number            |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| [wan]{.glyph}<br/>[wan]{.glyphsubtitle}   | One (1)           |
| [tu]{.glyph}<br/>[tu]{.glyphsubtitle}     | Two (2)           |
| [luka]{.glyph}<br/>[luka]{.glyphsubtitle} | Five (5)          |
| [mute]{.glyph}<br/>[mute]{.glyphsubtitle} | Twenty (20)       |
| [ale]{.glyph}<br/>[ale]{.glyphsubtitle}   | One Hundred (100) |

:::

Here are some quick examples:

<details><summary> [sina jo e kasi mute luka tu]{.tokipona} </summary>

You have twenty seven (27, 20+5+2) plants.

</details>

<details><summary> [jan ale ale wan li lon]{.tokipona} </summary>

There are two hundred and one (201, 100+100+1) people here.

</details>

<details><summary> [mi lukin e lipu luka luka luka]{.tokipona} </summary>

I've read fifteen (15, 5+5+5) books.

</details>

Of course, this won't let you refer to numbers like _one million_ so easily. But when was the last time a million of something was important to distinguish from "a lot?"

### kin

[kin]{.tokipona} makes something additional or extra to something else. It's like saying "too" in English.

It can be used in the subject

<details><summary> [mi kin li wile ni]{.tokipona} </summary>

I (and somebody else) also want to do this!

</details>

<details><summary> [kasi li loje kin]{.tokipona} </summary>

This plant is red (and another color), too!

</details>

<details><summary> [mi lukin e lipu kin]{.tokipona} </summary>

I read this book (and read something else).

</details>

<details><summary> [ona li pana e ni tawa sina kin]{.tokipona} </summary>

They gave this to you (and somebody else), too

</details>

When something is extra, it means there is another thing happening besides the thing being said!

### anu

[anu]{.tokipona} is a particle that works like the word "or" in English. It joins parts of speech like repeating a particle, but it means "or" instead of "and".

Here's an example of [anu]{.tokipona} in each part of speech, starting with the subject:

<details><summary> [mi anu sina li ken pali e ni]{.tokipona} </summary>

You or I can make this.

</details>

Then the predicate:

<details><summary> [sina ken jo anu pakala e ilo]{.tokipona} </summary>

You can keep or break the tool.

</details>

In the object:

<details><summary> [soweli li ken moku e kili anu kala]{.tokipona} </summary>

The cat can eat a fruit or a fish!

</details>

And lastly, with an entire prepositional phrase:

<details><summary> [jan alasa li lape lon tomo anu lon poki lape]{.tokipona} </summary>

The hunter is sleeping in their cabin or sleeping bag.

</details>

[anu]{.tokipona} can join any number of phrases, so it doesn't stop there! You could use this to list out a bunch of possibilities. Obviously, fewer is better for clarity!
