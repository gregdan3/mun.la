Let's explore how you could use Toki Pona without [pi]{.tp}!

## Why?

 Even
if you keep using [pi]{.tp} (and please do!), you'll find this lesson helps
you understand Toki Pona better!
All [pi]{.tp} does is groups modifiers, but it isn't the only way you can do that. Most particles introduce a new head noun, which you can describe however you like with much more detail than a [pi]{.tp} phrase. If your grammar gets especially complicated, you can start a new sentence instead.
Speaking Toki Pona depends on both of these facts! As such, you'll find it surprisingly easy to avoid using [pi]{.tp}.


### Using [pi]{.tp}

If you use more than one [pi]{.tp} in a phrase, there are suddenly two different interpretations of the grammar which have different meanings. If that weren't enough, these two interpretations cannot be told apart in speech or writing- only in [sitelen+pona]{.tp}. When using multiple [pi]{.tp}, either of the following are possible:


First, each [pi]{.tp} can affect the head noun, and not each other.

> [mi jan pi (kama sona) pi (toki pona)]{.tp} 


This would be interpreted something like "I am a person of learning _and_ Toki Pona."
Importantly, the two descriptors are separate: This person is a learner, and they are
associated with Toki Pona. They aren't necessarily learning Toki Pona!

Second, each consecutive [pi]{.tp} can affect the previous.

> [mi jan pi (kama sona pi (toki pona)]{.tp}

::: warning

The font rendering isn't perfect- there would be two fully-underlined [pi]{.tp}
phrases in handwriting. For now, just note the lack of a break between them.

:::

This would be interpreted more like "I am a person of learning Toki Pona." Here, the two
phrases *are* related, so the translation demonstrates that: learning and Toki Pona are
part of the same idea. 

These examples are unambiguous because of [sitelen+pona]{.tp}, but this clarity isn't possible in the latin alphabet or in speech. Without visible markings of when [pi]{.tp} phrases start and end, you'd need either another form of marking (such as emphasis in speech) or sufficient context to tell which meaning was intended.

Or, you can restate the sentence entirely without [pi]{.tp}!

### Removing [pi]{.tp}

If you restate these sentences without [pi]{.tp}, you can remove the
grammatical ambiguity created by it. For example:

> [mi jan li kama sona li toki pona]{.tp}

This is a restatement of the first example sentence. There are now three verbs:
[jan]{.tp}, [kama sona]{.tp}, and [toki pona]{.tp}, which all
separately describe the subject [mi]{.tp}: "I am a person, and I learn, and I
(speak) Toki Pona." Next example:

> [mi jan li kama sona e toki pona]{.tp}

This is a restatement of the second example sentence. However, there are now only two
verbs: [jan]{.tp} and [kama sona]{.tp}. The second [pi]{.tp} phrase
is now an object, which better describes the relationship of [kama sona]{.tp}
to [toki pona]{.tp}: "I am a person, and I am learning Toki Pona."

::: info

You can use more than once sentence instead of using [li]{.tp} to extend a
sentence! This is especially helpful if you express multiple *unrelated* ideas in one
sentence. For example:

> [mi jan. mi kama sona e toki pona]{.tp}

:::

## Examples

Try to restate these phrases without [pi]{.tp}. You can look at my suggested restatement under the spoiler!

<details><summary> [mi jan pi pana sona]{.tp} </summary>

- [mi jan li mi pana e sona.]{.tp}
- [mi jan. mi pana e sona.]{.tp}

::: info

Even though this example didn't have two [pi]{.tp} phrases, I still recommend
using [e]{.tp} here. Just like the walkthrough example with nested [pi]{.tp}
phrases, the intent of the sentnece is more clear when using appropriate grammar!

:::

</details>

Here, [pana sona]{.tp} is a single adjective that modifies [jan]{.tp}. Using [pi]{.tp} joins all following adjectives into a single adjective, [pana sona]{.tp} describes [jan]{.tp}. If you wanted to break this up, recognize that both [jan]{.tp} and [pana sona]{.tp} describe the subject of the sentence, [mi]{.tp}- so the split up version should still describe [mi]{.tp}!

<details><summary> [mi tawa tomo suli pi kama wawa]{.tp} </summary>

- [mi tawa tomo suli li kama wawa lon tomo ni]{.tp}
- [mi tawa tomo suli li kama wawa lon ona]{.tp}
- [mi tawa tomo suli. tomo ni la mi kama wawa]{.tp}
- [mi tawa tomo suli la mi kama wawa]{.tp}

</details>

Here, the adjectives behind [pi]{.tp} now modify something other than the subject- they modify the object of a preposition, here [tomo]{.tp}. This can also easily be broken up, with a separate sentence describing the [tomo]{.tp}. However, there is a purpose to the [kama wawa]{.tp} that actually goes back to applying to the subject! While restating this, ask yourself: What would you go to a [tomo pi kama wawa]{.tp} to do?

## Takeaway

You can always use Toki Pona's more simple grammar 
words to make a clearer sentence. Instead of trying to pack a ton of information into
one phrase, let the information breathe by spreading it throughout a sentence or two
with appropriate particles. You don't need to get rid of [pi]{.tokipona} entirely to
benefit from using it less often, and thinking about how you could express yourself
without it!
