In summary, the two **are** different!

- "[taso]{.tokipona}, ..." is particle-y and "[taso la]{.tokipona}, ..." is using [taso]{.tokipona} as a content word like how it works as a modifier.
- "[kin la]{.tokipona}, ..." uses [kin]{.tokipona} as a content word like how it works as a modifier
- "[kin]{.tokipona}, ..." is pretty rare but it usually is used to mean the same thing as "[kin la]{.tokipona}, ..."

## [taso]{.tokipona}

[taso]{.tokipona} at the start of a sentence is different from [taso]{.tokipona} as a modifier. Here's [taso]{.tokipona} at the start of a sentence:
[taso]{.tokipona} between two different sentences, at the start of the second but without [la]{.tokipona} says "these two sentences are related; the second is clarifying or contradictory to the former." It's like "But, ..." or "However, ..." in English!

For comparison, "[taso la]{.tokipona}, ..." says "the idea expressed by this sentence is exclusive in some way", for example "[taso la mi pali e ilo]{.tokipona}". I exclusively create tools. This is using [taso]{.tokipotasona} as a content word, and makes the entire sentence "exclusive" or "only."

This sentence-start [taso]{.tokipona} is _sometimes_ analyzed as an interjection, but that would imply it could be used elsewhere with this meaning; I consider it to be part of the sentence.

## [kin]{.tokipona}

[kin]{.tokipona} is usually a modifier, like [taso]{.tokipona}. It has no common-use reason for being at the start of a sentence in the way [taso]{.tokipona} can be (i.e. without [la]{.tokipona}), but you often can do "[kin la]{.tokipona}, ..." which is to say "the idea expressed by this sentence is additional to something else," kinda like leading a sentence with "Also, ..." in English. Some speakers use "[kin]{.tokipona}, ..." without [la]{.tokipona} to mean the same thing, but it's pretty rare.

The inconsistency in function is a matter of usage, in my experience; people understand "[taso la]{.tokipona}, ..." differently from "[taso]{.tokipona}, ..." because of [taso] content word in the former, and [taso]{.tokipona}'s unique sentence-start behavior in the latter.. Whereas in [kin]{.tokipona}, "[kin la]{.tokipona}, ..." is likely the same as using "[kin]{.tokipona}" somewhere in the sentence as a modifier.
