## Words to Know

Each lesson has new words to learn, including the symbol each word is written
with.

::: info

If you're ever lost, [use this dictionary](https://linku.la)! You can copy and
paste the symbols in these lessons, or search for the word if you already know
it.

:::

It may seem hard to learn a new language and its writing system together, but
don't worry: Each symbol represents something about the word, so learning the
word, symbol, and meaning all at once is much easier! To help, I also describe
how to remember and draw each symbol.

### You and I

The most basic Toki Pona sentence has two parts: a subject and a predicate. The
subject does something, and the predicate is what they do!

> [subject] [predicate]

For this kind of sentence, two subjects are possible:

- [mi]{.tp} - First person pronoun. I, me, my, mine, we, our, myself, ourselves
- [sina]{.tp} - Second person pronoun. You, yours, yourself, y'all, y'all's

So these sentences will always look like this:

> [[mi]{.tp}/[sina]{.tp}] [predicate]

The English interpretation looks like this for [mi]{.tp}:

> I am [description]
>
> I [action]
>
> We are [description]
>
> We [action]

You'll notice that [mi]{.tp} is translated as "I" or "we," even though the word
didn't change. In Toki Pona, words can refer to any number of people or things,
and they don't change to do that!

Then, here are the English interpretations for [sina]{.tp}:

> You are [description]
>
> You [action]
>
> Y'all are [description]
>
> Y'all [action]

In all of these examples, the predicate is either an action or a description-
either what the subject is doing, or what the subject is! Keep that in mind as
you translate the following:

<details> <summary> [mi jan]{.tp} (click for the translation!) </summary>

Since [jan]{.tp} (person/people) doesn't make much sense as an action, we
translate it as a description. This sentence means "**I am a person**" or "**We
are people.**"

</details>

[mi]{.tp} is the subject, and refers to the speaker. [jan]{.tp} is the
predicate, and is either an action or description of the speaker. Check your
understanding under the spoiler by clicking it!

<details> <summary> [sina moku]{.tp} </summary>

Because [moku]{.tp} (food/eat) could be either a description or an action, this
sentence could be "**You eat**" or "**You are food.**" Both are valid!

But even though this sentence _could_ mean either one, "**You eat**" is a more
common and more reasonable meaning than "**You are food.**" When translating,
keep that "reasonable" point in mind!

</details>

[sina]{.tp} is the subject, and refers to the listener. [moku]{.tp} is the
predicate, and is either an action or description of the listener. Again, check
your understanding under the spoiler!

### Words and Context

We saw that [mi]{.tp} can be used like "I" or like "we," and we'll see it work
like "my" and "myself" and "our" in future lessons! We also saw that the
predicate can be an action, or a description- putting it another way, Toki Pona
doesn't tell you the difference between "being red" and "redding," the act of
being red! Here's the bigger picture:

- **Words don't mark number!** [jan]{.tp} may talk about one person, fourteen
  people, everyone in a city, a hypothetical person, and more.
- **Words don't mark time!** [moku]{.tp} may talk about eating right now, going
  out to eat next week, drinking months ago, and anything else.
- **Words don't mark gender!** [mama]{.tp} can any parent, guardian, or
  ancestor, regardless of gender.

Other languages put this information into the way words are said, or into the
grammar of the sentence. In Toki Pona, you'd either say that information with
words, or leave it to context: Who said this, and when? The words don't change-
but the context does!

To practice this idea, try to think of as many ways to translate these sentences
as you can. Remember: you can change number, time, gender, and even the specific
action or description- as long as it fits into the meaning of the word!

<details> <summary> [mi lape]{.tp} </summary>

- I slept.
- I'm sleeping.
- I was relaxing.
- I'm taking a nap.
- I'm going to sleep.
- We're asleep.
- We're going to rest.
- We're about to sleep!

</details>

<details> <summary> [sina tawa]{.tp} </summary>

- You're walking
- You jogged
- You will sprint
- You will have run
- You ran away!
- You're leaving
- You left
- You logged out
- You crawled!
- You're shaking!

</details>

<details> <summary> [sina mama]{.tp} </summary>

- You're a parent!
- You're a mom!
- You're a dad.
- Y'all are parents.
- You'll babysit.
- Y'all babysat.
- Youâ€™ve been a babysitter.
- You're a parental figure.
- You have parented before.

</details>

Tip: You can translate these sentences in **dozens** of ways, especially with
appropriate context- you'll probably think of something that isn't listed!

### Asking Questions

No language is complete without questions, and Toki Pona is no different! There
are three ways to ask questions in Toki Pona, but we'll focus on the simplest
for this lesson: **Yes or no questions!**

To ask a yes or no question, you double the first word of the predicate, then
put [**ala**]{.tp} between them. Here's a common example:

<details> <summary> [sina pona ala pona?]{.tp} </summary>

- You good or not good?
- Are you okay?
- Are you well?
- Are you alright?
- Are you hurt?

::: info

The above translations are more literal, while the ones below are made to make
more sense in English. All of these are ways you might _translate_ this
sentence, but the meaning in Toki Pona is what's most important!

:::

- How are you?
- Doing okay?

</details>

The subject, [sina]{.tp}, is exactly the same as before. But now, there's more
going on in the predicate

To answer a yes or no question, you can say an entire sentence back, or just
repeat the true part of the predicate- in the above example, you'd say
[pona]{.tp} for yes, or [ala]{.tp} for no.

You can think of yes or no questions as

### Hello and Goodbye

In Toki Pona, there are no specific words for "hello" or "goodbye."

Instead, "hello" is part of the word [toki]{.tp}. It covers every kind of
greeting!

<details> <summary> [toki]{.tp} </summary>

- Hello!
- Hi!
- Hey!
- 'sup!
- Howdy!
- G'day!
- Good morning!
- Good afternoon!
- Good evening!

</details>

That's it! If you're starting a conversation with somebody, hit 'em with a
[toki]{.tp}!

But saying "goodbye" is a bit different. To say goodbye, you describe how you're
leaving: by moving!

<details> <summary> [mi tawa]{.tp} </summary>

- I'm leaving
- I'm going
- I'm traveling
- I'm walking
- I'm moving
- I'm logging off!
- Bye! (non-literal)

</details>

This is the most common way to say goodbye in Toki Pona, but it isn't the only
one. I'll point out more in future lessons!

## Exercises

Try to figure out what these statements mean in English, then check your answer
under the spoiler! The first answer is the one that best fits the given context,
and the rest are other ways that sentence could be understood, but in different
contexts.

All Toki Pona to English exercises include some situation as context, because
language lives in context! Toki Pona is no exception. Knowing _when_ a sentence
is said helps you understand _why_ it was said, and thus what it means.

### I and we

You're about to go up to the podium on stage and give a speech. Before stepping
on stage, you say to an attendent:

conversation:

<details> <summary>

::: {.tp .convo}

sina pona ala pona?!

mi pona!

:::

</summary>

::: {.convo}

Are you alright?!

I'm fine!

:::

</details>

<!--You're wearing your headphones, listening to music and not paying a lot of-->
<!--attention to the outside world. However, -->

### Hello, Goodbye

A group of students are sitting in their seats, waiting for their early morning

Good morning!

---

- Hello!
- Hi!
- Good evening!
- (literally) Conversation is starting!

I'm going!

---

- I'm traveling
- I'm moving
- I'm walking
- I'm running
- (non-literally) Goodbye!

</details>

### English

Try to figure out how you'd say these English sentences in Toki Pona! This time,
no context is given- this means the answer will be much more simple and literal,
but also easier to figure out!

<details> <summary> I'm eating.</summary>

[mi moku]{.tp}

</details>

<details> <summary> I'm tall.</summary>

[mi suli]{.tp}

</details>

<details> <summary> I'm leaving! </summary>

## Summary

<!--- You can now make sentences with [mi]{.tp} and [sina]{.tp}, letting you talk about-->
<!--  yourself and whoever you're speaking to!-->
<!--- Y-->

<!-- ### Sentences about "you" and "I" -->
<!---->
<!-- ### Saying hello and goodbye -->
<!---->

### What can you say now?

By now, you can make sentences with [mi]{.tp} and [sina]{.tp}, so you can talk
about yourself and whoever you're speaking to! You can also ask some questions.
This may not seem like a lot, but you can already follow this conversation:

<details>
<summary>

::: {.tp .convo}

toki!

toki! sina pona ala pona?

mi pona! mi moku, mi lape

pona! mi tawa

tawa pona!

:::

</summary>

Here's a translation that sounds natural in English:

::: convo

Hi!

Hi! How are you?

I'm great! I had dinner, and I'm about to sleep.

Nice! I'm going now.

Have a nice day!

:::

And here's a literal interpretation:

::: convo

Hi!

Hi! Are you good, or not good?

I'm good! I eat, and I sleep!

Nice! I'm walking.

Walk well!

:::

</details>

You already know all the words here, and there's only one bit of grammar we
haven't learned yet. It's not a lot, but you have everything you need to get
started!

### What did you learn?

In Toki Pona, a sentence could be understood many different ways, depending on
when it's said! And there are two reasons for that:

**Toki Pona words are broad in meaning**

In Toki Pona, words don't tell you about number, time, or gender. They also
don't care if they're being used as a verb or adjective, or anything else.
Because of that, each word can have a huge number of possible meanings.

Instead of changing the words to tell you about time or number, Toki Pona lets
you figure things out from context- or spell it out literally, as we'll learn
later!

**Actions and descriptions are the same thing**

In Toki Pona, there is no grammatical difference between "doing" and "being."
The predicate does both! To describe it in English, you could say that if a
person walks, they are also a walking person.

Bu this is better understood in Toki Pona: You might assume that [mi tawa]{.tp} means
"I'm walking" or maybe "I'm leaving." But it could just as easily mean "I am being
shaken!"
