## Overview

#### You and I

The most basic Toki Pona sentence has two parts: a subject phrase and a predicate phrase.

> [subject] [predicate]

For this kind of sentence, two subjects are possible

- [mi]{.tokipona} - First person pronoun. I, me, my, mine, we, our, myself, ourselves
- [sina]{.tokipona} - Second person pronoun. You, yours, yourself, y'all, y'all's

So the Toki Pona sentence always looks like this:

> [[mi]{.tokipona}/[sina]{.tokipona}] [predicate]

The English interpretation looks like this for mi:

> I am [description]
>
> I [action]
>
> We are [description]
>
> We [action]

And this for sina:

> You are [description]
>
> You [action]
>
> Y'all are [description]
>
> Y'all [action]

The words in the predicate describe the speaker or listener, or what the speaker or listener is doing. For example:

<details> <summary> [mi jan]{.tokipona} </summary>

Since jan (person/people) doesn't obviously imply an action, it is reasonable to call it a description here. This sentence means "**I am a person**" or "**We are people.**"

</details>

[mi]{.tokipona} is the subject, and refers to the speaker.
[jan]{.tokipona} is the predicate, and is either an action or description of the speaker.
Check under the spoiler for an explanation and interpretation!

<details> <summary> [sina moku]{.tokipona} </summary>

Because moku (food/eat) could be either a description or an action, this sentence could be "**You eat**" or "**You are food.**"

Importantly, "**You eat**" is _much_ more likely and common than "**You are food.**" A sentence should be reasonable when you interpret it!

</details>

[sina]{.tokipona} is the subject, and refers to the listener.
[moku]{.tokipona} is the predicate, and is either an action or description of the listener.

#### Hello and Goodbye

In Toki Pona, there is no specific word for "hello" or for "goodbye."

Instead, "hello" is part of the word [toki]{.tokipona}.
It covers every kind of greeting!

<details> <summary> [toki]{.tokipona} </summary>

- Hello!
- Good morning!
- Hi!
- Hey!

</details>

And saying "goodbye" is to describe how you're leaving, by moving!

<details> <summary> [mi tawa]{.tokipona} </summary>

- I'm leaving
- I'm going
- I'm traveling
- I'm walking
- I'm moving

</details>

This is the most common way to say "goodbye" in Toki Pona.

## Exercises

::: info

Translation is inexact! Toki Pona words have broad meanings, so answers are a list of possibilities, _not_ comprehensive.

:::

Try to figure out what these statements mean in English! All answers are under the spoiler. The first statement will be an in-context interpretation. The rest will be examples of what the sentence _could_ mean, regardless of context.

All Toki Pona to English exercises will include a situation as context for the statement.
Language lives in context, and Toki Pona is no exception.
Knowing what is going on will help you understand the statement, and will improve your learning.

## Takeaway

There are many given definitions and sentence interpretations. This is
intended! And it comes from two different effects:

#### Action/Description Duality

As noted before, words in the predicate may be actions, descriptions, or
both! In fact, often if something is an action, it is also a description. In English, you
might say that if a person walks, they are also a walking person. Toki Pona
runs with this idea. There is no difference between "doing" and "being"
expressed by the grammar.

#### Broadness

Toki Pona words have broad meanings. [mi]{.tokipona} does not refer to only yourself like
"I" does. It can refer to a group including yourself like "we",
an action on yourself like "myself", and something that belongs to you
such as "mine" or "my"; all of these depend on context and place in a sentence.
[sina]{.tokipona} works the same way, and so do _all_ Toki Pona words.

In short, words do not mark number! [jan]{.tokipona} may talk about one person,
four people, everyone in a city, and more.

Words do not mark time either! [moku]{.tokipona} may
talk about eating right now, eating in the near future, drinking in the distant
past, becoming edible exactly a week from now, and anything else.

Broadness is part of the strength of Toki Pona. It
is easier to navigate than you think! Context is everything, and understanding
a sentence is much easier when you're experiencing what it describes.

A helpful strategy for understanding a sentence with less context is
to consider how reasonable it is. For example, [mi moku]{.tokipona} is able to mean "we
are food", but it is more likely that [mi]{.tokipona} is just the speaker, and [moku]{.tokipona} is
"eat". You can use this thinking to reason about sentences in the future.

#### Hello and Goodbye

As in one of the examples, which is _not_ a sentence, you can say [toki]{.tokipona} on its own to mean "hello!"

Another one of the examples is a sentence, and is the most common way to say goodbye: [mi tawa]{.tokipona}, "I am leaving!"
