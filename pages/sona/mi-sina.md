## Words to Know

Each lesson has new words to learn, including the symbol each word is written
with.

::: info

If you're ever lost, [use this dictionary](https://linku.la)! You can copy and
paste the symbols in these lessons, or search for the word if you already know
it.

:::

It may seem hard to learn a new language and its writing system together, but
don't worry: Each symbol represents something about the word, so learning the
word, symbol, and meaning all at once is much easier! To help, I also describe
how to remember and draw each symbol.

### You and I

The most basic Toki Pona sentence has two parts: a [subject]{.h1} and a
[predicate]{.h2}. The subject does something, and the predicate is what they do!
To start, we'll only have one word in each, so here's an example:

> [[mi]{.h1} [toki]{.h2}]{.tp}

This kind of sentence can start with [mi]{.tp} (mi) to mean "I", or [sina]{.tp}
(sina) to mean "you". Every sentence in this lesson will be one of these, so
they'll always look like this:

> [[mi]{.tp}/[sina]{.tp}] [predicate]

If a sentence starts with [mi]{.tp}, you could read it in any of these ways:

> I am [description]
>
> I [action]
>
> We are [description]
>
> We [action]

You'll notice that [mi]{.tp} can be translated as "I" or "we"- it can be
singular or plural, even though the word didn't change. In Toki Pona, words can
refer to any number of people or things!

Then, if a sentence started with [sina]{.tp}, you could read it in any of these
ways:

> You are [description]
>
> You [action]
>
> Y'all are [description]
>
> Y'all [action]

In all of these examples, the predicate is either an action or a description-
either what the subject is doing, or what the subject is! Keep that in mind, and
try to translate this sentence:

<details> <summary> [[mi]{.h1} [jan]{.h2}]{.tp} (click for the translation!) </summary>

Since [jan]{.tp} (person/people) doesn't make much sense as an action, we
translate it as a description. This sentence means "**[I]{.h1} am a
[person]{.h2}**" or "**[We]{.h1} are [people]{.h2}.**"

</details>

[mi]{.tp} is the [subject]{.h1}, and refers to the speaker. [jan]{.tp} is the
[predicate]{.h2}, and is either an action or description of the speaker. Check
your understanding under the spoiler by clicking it!

<details> <summary> [[sina]{.h1} [moku]{.h2}]{.tp} </summary>

Because [moku]{.tp} (food/eat) could be either a description or an action, this
sentence could be "**You eat**" or "**You are food.**" Both are valid!

But even though this sentence _could_ mean either one, "**You eat**" is a more
common and more reasonable meaning than "**You are food.**" When translating,
keep that "reasonable" point in mind!

</details>

[sina]{.tp} is the [subject]{.h1}, and refers to the listener. [moku]{.tp} is
the [predicate]{.h2}, and is either an action or description of the listener.
Again, check your understanding under the spoiler!

### Words and Context

We saw that [mi]{.tp} can be used like "I" or like "we," and we'll see it work
like "my" and "myself" and "our" in future lessons! The same goes for
[sina]{.tp}, which is used for "you" or "y'all", and will mean "yours" or
"yourself" in future lessons.

<!--Expanding on that, you'll often see [mi]{.tp} and [sina]{.tp} defined with many-->
<!--different examples, like this:-->
<!---->
<!--- [mi]{.tp} - All first person pronouns. I, me, my, mine, we, our, myself,-->
<!--  ourselves-->
<!--- [sina]{.tp} - All person pronouns. You, yours, yourself, y'all, y'all's-->

<!--And this is because Toki Pona words change based on context- like, who or what-->
<!--are we talking about, and where in the sentence is the word?-->

Each word can take on so many different meanings because Toki Pona words mean
different things in different contexts! And plurality isn't the only thing that
can change. In the previous section, we saw that the predicate can be an action
or a description- putting it another way, Toki Pona doesn't tell you the
difference between "being red" and "redding," the act of being red! Here's the
bigger picture:

- **Words don't mark number!** [jan]{.tp} may talk about one person, fourteen
  people, everyone in a city, a hypothetical person, and more.
- **Words don't mark time!** [moku]{.tp} may talk about eating right now, going
  out to eat next week, drinking months ago, and anything else.
- **Words don't mark gender!** [mama]{.tp} can be any parent, guardian, or
  ancestor, regardless of gender.

Other languages put this information into the way words are said, or into the
grammar of the sentence. In Toki Pona, you'd either say that information with
words, or leave it to context: Who said this, and when? The words don't change-
but the context does!

To practice this idea, try to think of as many ways to translate these sentences
as you can. Remember: you can change number, time, gender, and even the specific
action or description- as long as it fits into the meaning of the word!

<details> <summary> [mi lape]{.tp} </summary>

- I slept.
- I'm sleeping.
- I was relaxing.
- I'm taking a nap.
- I'm going to sleep.
- We're asleep.
- We're going to rest.
- We're about to sleep!

</details>

<details> <summary> [sina tawa]{.tp} </summary>

- You're walking
- You jogged
- You will sprint
- You will have run
- You ran away!
- You're leaving
- You left
- You logged out
- You crawled!
- You're shaking!

</details>

<details> <summary> [sina mama]{.tp} </summary>

- You're a parent!
- You're a mom!
- You're a dad.
- Y'all are parents.
- You'll babysit.
- Y'all babysat.
- Youâ€™ve been a babysitter.
- You're a parental figure.
- You have parented before.

</details>

Tip: You can translate these sentences in **dozens** of ways, especially with
appropriate context- you'll probably think of something that isn't listed!

### Your First Question

No language is complete without questions, and Toki Pona is no different! There
are three ways to ask questions in Toki Pona, but we'll focus on the simplest
for this lesson: **Yes or no questions!**

To ask a yes or no question, you double the first word of the [predicate]{.h2},
then put [**ala**]{.tp} (ala) in between. Here's an example:

<details> <summary> [[sina]{.h1} [pona ala pona]{.h2}?]{.tp} </summary>

- Are you okay?
- Are you well?
- Are you alright?
- Are you hurt?
- You good or not good?

::: info

The above translations are more literal, while the ones below are made to make
more sense in English. All of these are ways you might _translate_ this
sentence, but the meaning in Toki Pona is what's most important!

:::

- How are you?
- Doing okay?

</details>

The [subject]{.h1}, [sina]{.tp}, is exactly the same as before. But now, there's
more going on in the predicate that turns it into a question! We'll see longer
sentences in the future, but it's always that first word, doubled and with
[ala]{.tp} between, which makes a statement into a question.

To answer a yes or no question, you can say an entire sentence back, or just
repeat the true part of the predicate- in the above example, you'd say
[pona]{.tp} for yes, or [ala]{.tp} for no.

You can think of yes or no questions as

### Hello and Goodbye

In Toki Pona, there are no specific words for "hello" or "goodbye."

Instead, "hello" is part of the word [toki]{.tp}. It covers every kind of
greeting!

<details> <summary> [toki]{.tp} </summary>

- Hello!
- Hi!
- Hey!
- 'sup!
- Howdy!
- G'day!
- Good morning!
- Good afternoon!
- Good evening!

</details>

That's it! If you're starting a conversation with somebody, hit 'em with a
[toki]{.tp}!

But saying "goodbye" is a bit different. To say goodbye, you describe how you're
leaving: by moving!

<details> <summary> [mi tawa]{.tp} </summary>

- I'm leaving
- I'm going
- I'm traveling
- I'm walking
- I'm moving
- I'm logging off!
- Bye! (non-literal)

</details>

This is the most common way to say goodbye in Toki Pona, but it isn't the only
one. I'll point out more in future lessons!

## Exercises

Try to translate these sentences to English, then check your understanding under
the spoiler! The first answer fits the given context, but the rest are valid for
other contexts.

<!--::: info-->

<!--You don't need to do every exercise! -->
<!---->
<!--:::-->

All Toki Pona to English exercises include some situation as context, because
language lives in context! Toki Pona is no exception. Knowing _when_ a sentence
is said helps you understand _why_ it was said, and thus what it means.

## Summary

### What did you learn?

In Toki Pona, a word can be understood in many different ways, depending on when
it's said and where it is in the sentence! And there are two reasons for that:

**1. Toki Pona words are broad in meaning**

In Toki Pona, words don't tell you about number, time, or gender. They also
don't care if they're being used as a verb or adjective, or anything else.
Because of that, each word can have a huge number of possible meanings- a huge
number of things they can refer to!

Instead of changing the words to tell you about time or number, Toki Pona lets
you figure things out from context- or spell it out literally, as we'll learn
later!

**2. Actions and descriptions are the same thing**

In Toki Pona, there is no grammatical difference between "doing" and "being."
The predicate does both! To describe it in English, you could say that if a
person walks, they are also a walking person.

But this is better understood in Toki Pona: You might assume that [mi
tawa]{.tp} means "I'm walking" or maybe "I'm leaving." But it could just as easily
mean "I am being shaken!"

### What can you say now?

By now, you can say hello or goodbye, read and make sentences with [mi]{.tp} and
[sina]{.tp}, and ask a variety of useful questions. This may not seem like a
lot, but you already have all the pieces you need to follow along with some
conversations, and even join them!

<!--, so you can talk about yourself and whoever you're speaking to! You can also-->
<!--ask important questions, like whether somebody understands you, or if they're-->
<!--okay.-->

### Test yourself!

Here's a short conversation, entirely in toki pona! It covers everything you've
learned in this lesson. You've seen all the words here, and you've seen nearly
all the grammar here too- so you're more than ready to figure out what's being
said. Give it a shot, and good luck!

<details>
<summary>

::: {.tp .convo-you}

toki!

toki! sina pona ala pona?

mi pona! mi moku, mi lape

pona! mi tawa

tawa pona!

:::

</summary>

Here's a translation that sounds natural in English:

::: convo-you

Hi!

Hi! How are you?

I'm great! I had dinner, and I'm about to sleep.

Nice! I'm going now.

Have a nice day!

:::

And here's a literal interpretation:

::: convo-you

Hi!

Hi! Are you good, or not good?

I'm good! I eat, and I sleep!

Nice! I'm walking.

Walk well!

:::

</details>

If you don't get it yet, don't worry! Language learning takes time, even in Toki
Pona. Come back later and try again!

### What comes next?

Now that you can talk about yourself and whoever you're talking to, it's time to
introduce [**li**]{.tp} so we can talk about everyone and everything else! In
the next lesson, we'll have lots of examples of this new **verb marker**, and
cover a new form of questions too.
