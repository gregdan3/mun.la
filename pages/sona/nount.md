- all pu proper names, and for a long time proper names in general, were loans from other languages. this shows that proper names aren't a part of tp itself, but loaned from elsewhere. this can be interpreted as tp speakers not using such names for themselves, at least most of the time
- toki pona, in general, describes rather than assigns. it does not look at a thing, name it, and then always refer to it as such. this puts it at odds with the very concept of proper names at all. why would i refer to someone by some unique, otherwise useless word, when i could just describe how funny i think they are or that they're shaped like a stickbug? /lh
- i had more but forgor
