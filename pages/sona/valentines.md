Hey everyone, I'm gregdan3, and today I'm gonna tell you about how you give a
compliment in Toki Pona! In this lesson that definitely is on time for
Valentines Day!

<!--Now, I do want to say two quick things before I get started: I'm gonna be-->
<!--focusing on the compliments involved in flirting, and how that can work in Toki-->
<!--Pona. It's up to you to find somebody who wants the cmpl!-->
<!---->
<!--And the second, compliments are different to different people- and to different-->
<!--cultures. I grew up in the southern United States with my own set of-->
<!--experiences, and I don't think I'm going to be able to separate my experiences-->
<!--from this lesson- but with any luck, I can generalize enough that these lessons-->
<!--can still work for you. And, of course, we're going to be focusing on how-->
<!--compliments relate to and work in Toki Pona, so that helps!-->
<!---->
<!--With that out of the way, we can get right to it, starting with:-->

But what _is_ a compliment?

Just kidding.

Compliments take many forms.

They can focus on looks, personality traits, things you've done, skills you
have, things you care about, and tons more.

But the core of a compliment is pointing one of these things out, and saying
what you see that's so good about it!

And this is something Toki Pona excels at- the honesty and directness of a good
compliment is exactly what Toki Pona wants from _all_ communication.

So let's go through lots of examples of compliments given in Toki Pona, and see
if we can learn something about how to tell our friends we love them!

To start out:

---

Let's say a friend recently got a sweet haircut. It suits them so well. It's
sharp. It's perfect from morning to night.

How many ways can we tell them that their hair is amazing? First, we can just
say it:

::: tp

> linja lawa sina li pona mute a

:::

[Work this example]

The overall translation is then, "Your hair is amazing" or "Your hair is very
good."

This pattern is gonna show up a lot, because most compliments boil down to
describing something in a positive way.

But what if we wanted to get more specific? Let's add some detail:

---

::: tp

> sina weka tan lape lon tenpo poka, taso linja sina li awen pona tawa lukin

:::

[Work this example]

Here, we're giving essentially the same compliment as before to your friend with
the amazing hair. But this time, we're adding context to the compliment.

Translation: You woke up just a bit ago, but your hair still looks great!

The added context gives a little boost to the compliment. Your hair isn't just
good- I would've expected some bedhead, but no, you just woke up and your hair
is still great!

In other words, the compliment isn't just said for its own sake- there is a
specific reason why you're so impressed, and explaining that adds to the
compliment!

Let's look at another one:

---

What if you wanted to give a more intimate compliment, like for a partner or a
very close friend?

You need to have established trust to be able to give a compliment like this,
but we can still explore what it would look like in Toki Pona:

If you're close enough to somebody that you're playing with their hair, a
compliment to the feeling of their hair could be very welcome. Here's how you
might say it:

::: tp

> linja sina li suwi a tawa pilin. mi wile lape lon ona

:::

[work this example]

The translation is something like, "Your hair is soft to the touch. I want to
rest on it."

In this compliment, the focus shifts from just what you like- you're adding on
something about your own feelings, how you relate to what you're complimenting.
In the right context, and with somebody who's receptive, this type of compliment
can be lovely.

<!--This is from a really old discussion, but thanks to kulupu Kemeten and soweli-->
<!--Sopi for the inspiration on this one!-->

---

You'll notice that these compliments have been getting more complex as we went
on! Adding a bit more detail to the way you're feeling, the experience you've
had, or to the vibe you'd like to express- these things can help your compliment
feel more earnest. It isn't phatic- that is, it's _not_ something you're saying
just to say, or because you feel obligated to. There's a reason you're giving
this compliment: it means something to you, and you want it to mean something to
them!

Alright, that's enough hair compliments! Let's try another subject:

---

Let's imagine your friend is in an archery contest, and you came to watch but
you weren't totally sure what to expect. In the contest, your friend gets a
super impressive score and places first, so you have lots of congratulations to
give when you see them afterward! You come up to them and say:

::: tp

mi lon tenpo utala li lukin e sina! sina wawa mute.

sina sona wawa e nasin pi ilo alasa.

mi kama wile sona e ona.

:::

[work this example]

Bringing this translation together: I was at the archery contest, watching you!
You did great! You're very skilled with a bow. Now I want to learn (how to use
it).

I've picked a really specific example here, but it works for essentially any
skill: Your friend probably knows they're skilled- but it feels good to be seen,
and to be recognized for the skills you have. On top of that, if you're
sincerely interested, showing excitement for somebody else's hobby is a great
way to show how much their excitement means to you.

---

Alternatively, let's imagine your friend is especially skilled at crochet.
They're showing off some of their work, and you get so excited by what you see,
that you say:

> [sina sona pali e soweli len suwi! a ona li suwi wawa, mi wile e ona!]{.tokipona}

[Work this example]

The overall translation is about expressing your excitement: "You're super good
at making cute yarn animals! It's so cute, I want one!"

And this is another aspect of expressing a good compliment- like before, you're
talking about what they're skilled in, and like before, you're talking about how
that makes you feel. But a big part of a good compliment is how you present it
and yourself.

Your wording can express your excitement, and so can your face, tone, and body
language. If you're excited for your friend as you compliment them, the
compliment works that much better. For Toki Pona, that just means showing your
sincere feelings the way you feel them.

Let's try another example!

---

What if you're visiting a friend's home, and you're interested in the cool stuff
they've collected and displayed on their shelves, or the lovely arrangement of
their furniture?

Sometimes, a compliment can redirect just a bit, asking for somebody to tell a
story about something they care about.

::: tp

> tomo sina li pona a tawa mi! ijo wawa mute li lon. ni li seme? seme la sina jo
> e ona?

:::

[Work this example]

Here, we start with a short and to the point compliment of your friend's home,
but then redirect to the things in their home- and ask, what's this?

The full translation here is "Your home is lovely! There's so many cool things
here. What is this? How did you get it?"

Little tip: A lot of people love to talk about themselves, whether their skills,
their interests, their friends, any part of their story. Giving them that
opportunity can be just as fun for them telling the story as you hearing it!

---

Alright, one more!

> [mi tu li toki mute la mi pilin pona mute. tenpo kama la, sina wile ala wile musi?]

This one's not just a compliment. It's a prompt too:

"When the two of us talk, I feel great. Later, would you want to play a game?"

---

The takeaway here, the common thread, is actually something that works in any
language- not just in Toki Pona.

Compliments aren't just about the words you say- they're about how you say them,
and how you feel them too.

But Toki Pona does more than give you the tools for compliments- the sincerity
and literal-ness of Toki Pona _excels_ at expressing compliments.

That said, I have a last minute wrench to throw in the mix, and then I'll pull
it right out.

Something I haven't discussed here is subtext. Often, when giving a compliment,
the giver will have more feelings, more to say, beyond the literal
interpretation of their words. In some contexts, a compliment is more than just
a compliment. It can be a silent admission of pride, or a quiet way to show
attraction, or just a shy expression of your excitement for a shared hobby or
interest.

Or you know, a compliment can just be an honest compliment.

I'll be frank here. Subtext is not something I'm good at. But I find it hard to
believe that toki pona has _no_ subtext- you might run into it. But fortunately,
Toki Pona gives us one more tool to navigate that challenge: its earnestness
makes it a bit easier to just ask, how are you feeling?

Thank you so much for watching! Say something nice to a friend today!
