Hey everyone, I'm gregdan3, and today I'm gonna tell you about how you give a
compliment in Toki Pona!

<!--Now, I do want to say two quick things before I get started: I'm gonna be-->
<!--focusing on the compliments involved in flirting, and how that can work in Toki-->
<!--Pona. It's up to you to find somebody who wants the cmpl!-->
<!---->
<!--And the second, compliments are different to different people- and to different-->
<!--cultures. I grew up in the southern United States with my own set of-->
<!--experiences, and I don't think I'm going to be able to separate my experiences-->
<!--from this lesson- but with any luck, I can generalize enough that these lessons-->
<!--can still work for you. And, of course, we're going to be focusing on how-->
<!--compliments relate to and work in Toki Pona, so that helps!-->
<!---->
<!--With that out of the way, we can get right to it, starting with:-->

But what _is_ a compliment? Compliments take many forms.

They can focus on looks, personality traits, things you've done, skills you
have, things you care about, and tons more.

But the core is pointing one of these things out, and saying what you see that's
so good about it!

And this is something Toki Pona excels at- the honesty and directness of a good
compliment is exactly what Toki Pona wants from _all_ communication.

So let's go through lots of examples of compliments, given in Toki Pona!

This lesson is primarily example based, but I have a purely toki pona section
near the end!

---

Let's say a friend recently got a sweet haircut. It suits them so well. It's
sharp. It's perfect from morning to night.

How many ways can we tell them we thing their hair is amazing? First, we can
just say it:

> [linja lawa sina li pona mute a]{.tokipona}

[Work this example]

Which translates to, "Your hair is amazing" or "Your hair is very good."

This pattern is gonna show up a lot, because most compliments boil down to
describing something in a positive way.

But what if we wanted to get more specific? Let's make this way more

---

::: tp

> sina weka tan lape lon tenpo poka, taso linja sina li awen pona tawa lukin

:::

Here, we're giving essentially the same compliment to your friend with their
amazing hair. But this time, we're adding context to the compliment.

Translation: You woke up just a bit ago, but your hair still looks great!

The added context gives a little boost to the compliment. Your hair isn't just
good- I would've expected some bedhead, but no, your hair is still great!

In other words, the compliment isn't just said for its own sake- there is a
specific reason for why you're so impressed, and its adds to the compliment!

Let's look at another one:

---

<!-- What if you were watching a friend play basketball, and as they played their hair didn't move- it stayed perfectly in place, exactly how they want it? -->
<!---->
<!-- > [sina tawa wawa e sike la linja sina li tawa ala! mi wile e ni...]{.tokipona} -->
<!---->
<!-- Translated more naturally, "When you move the ball so quickly, your hair doesn't move at all! I'd love if my hair did that." -->

What if you wanted a more intimate compliment, like when you're already close to
somebody?

You need to have established trust to make this work, but we can still explore
what that might look like in Toki Pona:

If you're close enough to somebody that you're playing with their hair, a
compliment to the feeling of their hair could be very welcome. Let's have a
look:

> [linja sina li suwi a tawa pilin. mi wile lape lon ona]{.tokipona}

The translation is something like, "Your hair is soft to the touch. I want to
sleep on it"

Here, the focus shifts to how you relate to what you're complimenting-

This is from a really old discussion, but thanks to kulupu Kemeten and soweli
Sopi for the inspiration on this one!

---

You'll notice that these compliments got more complex as we went on! Adding a
bit more detail to the way you're feeling, the experience you've had, to the
vibe you'd like to express- these things can help your compliment feel more
earnest. It isn't phatic- that is, it's _not_ something you're saying just to
say, or because you feel obligated to. There's a reason you're giving this
compliment!

Alright, that's enough hair compliments! Let's try another subject:

---

Let's imagine your friend is in an archery contest, and you came to watch but
weren't totally sure what to expect. Your friend gets a super impressive score,
places first, and after the fact you come talk to them about it:

> [mi lukin e sina lon utala pi ilo alasa! sina sona wawa e > nasin pana.]{.tokipona}

translation: I was watching you in the archery contest. You're very skilled at
shooting.

I've picked a really specific example here, but this works for essentially any
skill: They probably know they're skilled- but it feels good to be seen, and to
be recognized for the skills you have.

---

Alternatively, let's imagine your friend is especially skilled at crochet.
They're showing off some of their work, and you're so excited by what you see,
you say:

> [sina sona pali e soweli len suwi! a ona li suwi wawa, mi wile e ona!]{.tokipona}

Here, the translation is about your excitement: "You're skilled in making cute
yarn animals! It's so cute, I want one!"

This is another expression of compliments: the way you present yourself says
something about the compliment and your feelings.

Your wording can express that, and so can your face and tone. If you're excited
for your friend as you compliment them, the compliment works that much better.

---

What if you're visiting a friend's home, and you're interested in everything on
their shelves, or the pretty arrangement of their place?

Sometimes, a compliment can redirect just a bit, asking for somebody to tell a
story:

> [tomo sina li pona a tawa mi! ijo mute li lon. ni li seme? seme la sina jo e ona?]

Here, we start with a short and to the point compliment of your friend's home,
but then redirect to the things in their home- and ask, what's this?

Little tip: A lot of people love to talk about themselves, their stuff, their
story. Giving them that opportunity can be just as fun for them telling the
story as you hearing it!

---

Alright, one more!

> [mi tu li toki mute la mi pilin pona mute. tenpo kama la, sina wile ala wile musi?]

This one's not just a compliment. It's a prompt too:

"When the two of us talk, I feel great. Later, would you want to play a game?"

---

The common thread here that every compliment works like this:

You take something you like about somebody and describe that something in a
positive way.

Toki Pona does more than give you the tools for compliments- the sincerity and
literal-ness of Toki Pona _excels_ at expressing compliments.

But one thing I haven't focused on here is subtext. Often, when giving a
compliment, the giver will have more feelings, more to say, beyond the literal
interpretation of their words. In some contexts, a compliment is just a
compliment. In others, it can be an admission of attraction, or of shared
excitement in a hobby or interest. Or you know, a compliment can just be an
honest compliment.

I'll be frank here. Subtext is not something I'm good at. But I find it hard to
believe that _no_ toki pona has subtext. Fortunately, Toki Pona gives us one
more tool: its earnesty makes it a bit easier to just ask, how are you feeling?

Or maybe ask...

> [toki a, suwi o. sina wile ala wile e ko]{.tokipona}
