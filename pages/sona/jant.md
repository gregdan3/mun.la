## Other Head Nouns

Some speakers don't use jan as their head noun. In fact, a lot of people do this!

For many new learners, there is an assumption that everyone they speak to will use jan as their head noun. However, many speakers will choose alternative head nouns for fun, because it feels more appropriate, or for personal expression.

To this end, any of Toki Pona's content words are viable head nouns. I have personally seen `soko Sonja`, `ona Itan`, `waso Keli`, `akesi Jan`, `palisa jelo kNatan`, and many more.
