## Overview

Questions are the cornerstone of speaking toki pona skillfully. Where a newbie speaker would be stuck wondering what a phrase or sentence means and not sure how to get past it, a skilled speaker knows what question to ask- in toki pona- to get the answer! In other words, if you master asking questions, you can make your way through any conversation!

In Toki Pona, there are three ways to ask questions, and many ways to answer them. You can use questions to cover gaps of all sorts- asking yes or no questions, clarifying something you misheard, asking what color and flavor yesterday was, and tons more.

Let's get into the first way of asking questions, with the word [ala]{.tokipona}.

#### Asking your first question with [ala]{.tokipona}

We can turn any sentence into a question by doubling the first word of the predicate, then adding [ala]{.tokipona} between them both. As a reminder, the predicate comes after [li]{.tokipona}, or after [mi]{.tokipona} or [sina]{.tokipona} if they're alone in the subject! Here are some examples:

<details><summary> [sina pona ala pona?]{.tokipona} </summary>

- Are you good?
- Are y'all healing?
- Is everyone okay?

</details>

<details><summary> [kasi ale li weka ala weka?]{.tokipona} </summary>

Are all the plants gone?

Did all the grass go away?

Will the forest disappear?

</details>

These questions are the closest to yes or no questions in English. But you might have noticed, Toki Pona has no words for answering questions- no "yes" and no "no"!

Instead, you answer questions by repeating the doubled word for "yes," or [ala]{.tokipona} for "no."
You may also say the word and [ala]{.tokipona} together for no.

> [ona li moku ala moku e ale?]{.tokipona}
>
> > [moku]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> Translation of the above! </summary>

> Did they eat everything?
>
> > Yep!

</details>

> [sina ken ala ken tawa?]{.tokipona}
>
> > [ala.]{.tokipona}
> >
> > [ken ala.]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> Translation of the above! </summary>

> Are you able to move?
>
> > No.
> >
> > Can't.

</details>

::: info

<!-- TODO: moveme -->

Some speakers will repeat sentences, partly or fully, when answering questions. If you repeat part of a question, start repeating it from a particle:

> [ona li pini ala pini e musi?]{.tokipona}
>
> > [ona li pini a]{.tokipona}

<details><summary>  Translation of the above! </summary>

> Did they end the game?
>
> > Yes, they ended (the game).

</details>

:::

#### Asking questions with [anu seme]{.tokipona}

Another way to ask questions is to add the phrase [anu seme]{.tokipona} to the end of it. This forms the same kind of question as [ala]{.tokipona} did before, but there are some tricks to it!

> [pipi li wile moku e pipi anu seme?]{.tokipona}
>
> > [wile]{.tokipona}

As in this example, you answer "yes" like before, repeating the first word of the predicate as though it were doubled.

You also answer "no" like before:

> [jan li kepeken ilo ni anu seme?]{.tokipona}
>
> > [ala]{.tokipona}
> >
> > [kepeken ala]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> Translation of the above! </summary>

> Is the person using this tool, or what?
>
> > No.
> >
> > Not using.

</details>

Questions formed with [anu seme]{.tokipona} are often about something the speaker wants to confirm.

In English, you might hear the question "You took out the trash, right?". The speaker expects you to have taken out the trash- the "right" part on the end shows that. So you'll respond "Yes, I did" or just "yes!". Hopefully!

You can ask the same type of question in Toki Pona using the phrase [anu seme]{.tokipona}. Here's the example from above, with both possible answers:

> [sina weka e jaki, anu seme?]{.tokipona}
>
> > [weka]{.tokipona}
> >
> > [weka ala...]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> Translation of the above! </summary>

> You took out the trash, right?
>
> > Yes!
> >
> > No...

</details>

[anu seme]{.tokipona} questions - but it doesn't have the possible answers built into the grammar, unlike the questions we looked at before. The speaker believes something, and they just want you to confirm it!

So, now that we get that, let's look at a few more fun cases with [anu seme]{.tokipona}

#### Asking about "no" with [anu seme]{.tokipona}

Since [anu seme]{.tokipona} can be added to any sentence, you can use it to confirm negatives too! This leans heavily into this idea of assumption

> [kulupu li tawa ala tomo anu seme?]{.tokipona}
>
> >

::: warning

Asking questions about negatives can be just as confusing in Toki Pona as in English! When in doubt, saying more words to answer a question clearly never hurts!

<!-- TODO: -->

- Asking about negatives
- Asking rhetorical questions

<!-- TODO: -->

#### [anu seme]{.tokipona} can be anywhere in the sentence?!

::: info

I've only discussed [anu seme]{.tokipona} at the end of sentences here, but you can add it to any part of speech! It's more common at the end of the sentence, so using it elsewhere can occasionally confuse your listener, but it's always valid.

You'll see more of how to do this in the next lesson when we look closer at [anu]{.tokipona}

:::

#### Asking questions with [seme]{.tokipona}

Another way to turn a sentence into a question is to replace any content word with [seme]{.tokipona}. This leaves a blank that your listener fills in, and you can put it anywhere!

#### Asking multiple questions at the same time

Sometimes, you have a lot of questions! Fortunately, Toki Pona speakers have lots of answers.

Questions formed with [ala]{.tokipona} aren't mixed with questions formed using [anu seme]{.tokipona}, because that would be redundant. This does the same thing to the sentence!

But you can put [seme]{.tokipona} in every part of a sentence, and it'll always form a valid question- even used more than once! The

> [seme la mi pana e mani seme tawa sina?]{.tokipona}
>
> > [o pana e mani kepeken lipu mani. o pana e mani luka luka tu.]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> Translation of the above! </summary>

> 1
>
> > 2

> How do I send you money, and how much do I send?
>
> > Send money with your credit card. Send twelve dollars.

::: warning

The translation here is pretty loose- the meaning is still the same, but the vibe is totally different. You've been warned!

:::

</details>

::: warning

Limit yourself to two [seme]{.tokipona} in a single sentence. The more you add, the more confusing your sentence gets-

#### Lots of ways to answer questions

#### Frequently Asked Questions

This section is a quick summary of a few common and important questions you'll need as you study and practice! This is only a starting point though- many of these can be asked in a variety of other ways more than I list here. Be open minded and creative!

**Who?** **What?**

Both of these are generally formed in the same way- put [seme]{.tokipona} in the subject!

> [seme li pali e ni?]{.tokipona}

If you know or need to be specific about the who or what being a person, then you would say [jan seme]{.tokipona}.

**Where?**

> [lon seme? lon ma seme?]{.tokipona}

**When?**

**Why?**

Why questions can be formed with [tan seme]{.tokipona} or [seme la ...]{.tokipona}!

**How?**

**Which?**

::: info

Several of the question fragments stated here are often valid as full questions! For example, if you said [lon seme?]{.tokipona} to somebody in the right context, they'd understand you to mean "where?"

## Takeaway

::: info
Fluency is _not_ about understanding everything. It's about knowing what questions to ask if you don't understand!

Skilled speakers aren't just skilled at expression and comprehension; they also are quick to ask appropriate questions when they don't understand something. Not understanding a statement has stopped being a hindrance or a reason to switch to another language; you can correct your understanding and continue in Toki Pona alone.
