toki a, jan ale o! mi jan Kekan San! mi wile pana e sona pi toki pona!

Hey everyone, I'm gregdan3, and today I wanna teach you about Toki Pona. A portion of this lesson is going to be in Toki Pona, so get ready! And if you're already skilled in Toki Pona, skip to this timecode to listen!

<!-- TODO: is this true? -->

Today, we're having another mini lesson, this time about an almost unnoticeable mistake learners make when getting into the language.

It starts with an introduction:

> [toki! mi jan [ken· kalama· nasa] [mute:]]{.tokipona}

No problem here! I'm giving you two pieces of information: What am I (jan), and what is my name (Kekan San)?

By the way, I've used my own name here, but I'm going to treat this exercise like anyone's name is there.

So let's say we're past introductions. What if I were telling you about my hobbies, my skills, or my job?

> [mi jan pi pana sona]{.tokipona}

Hmm... There's nothing _wrong_ here. This translation is correct: I'm a person who knowledge-gives. A teacher!

But there is something wrong. Something subtle.

Why is **jan** here?

We already introduced ourselves- so you already knew that I was jan.

It's not _wrong_ to say jan twice, but check how clean the sentence is without it:

> [mi pana sona]{.tokipona}

Big improvement! Not only was **jan** redundant, it was making the sentence a little harder to read.

We're talking about something we do- so why not get right to it?

But can we do better? Let's try this:

> [mi pana e sona]{.tokipona}

Turns out, using **jan** was limiting us here too!

By trying to cram all those words into modifiers of **jan**, we couldn't clearly indicate that **pana** was an action, or that **sona** was an object.

By separating them, we can make sentences much more natural, and more easily understood!

<!-- trouble one: stuffing everything into a noun phrase doesn't work when the intended noun is itself complex. what if I were a highly skilled software engineering teacher? -->
<!---->
<!-- trouble two: the word jan, or your own head noun, is redundant. the listener already knows it! -->

---

A lot of you will already be familiar with this phrase:

> [jan pona]{.tokinpona}

This phrase is often lexicalized- which means, to be reused with the same meaning over and over. It becomes part of the lexicon, part of the language as though it were a word.

I'm gonna call these stuck-words for ease of understanding, but understand I'm still referring back to lexicalized phrases.

"jan pona" is one of the most common stuck words in Toki Pona, and it's used to mean friend.

You'll hear people say:

> [mi jan pona sina]{.tokipona}

"I'm your good person"

When really they mean:

> [sina pona tawa mi]{.tokipona}

"You're special to me."

"jan pona" means much more than friend, of course.

But more importantly, "jan" isn't doing anything here but making our sentence harder to understand! Just like before.

There's a whole collection of stuck words like this, that start with jan.

So let's undo it!

There's a common ask where a newbie wants to translate the name of their job into Toki Pona.

They might ask it like, "How do I translate 'I'm a fireman' into Toki Pona?"

Let's answer it!

<!-- But think about this -->
<!---->
<!-- The important thing here is realizing that using "jan pona" to mean "friend" isn't the only problem here. -->
<!---->
<!-- There's a whole bunch of lexicalizations- all of them starting with jan, or at least your head noun- that work like this! -->

mi musi e musi Manka

mi musi Manka

Neither translation is wrong, but the former is redundant, and is a little bit stuck on how English forms sentences.

---

I'll be introducing myself!

---

toki! mi jan Kekan San. tenpo la mi pana e sona pi toki pona.

mi toki pona ala la mi pali e ilo wawa kepeken sona ilo kepeken sona jan. ni li tawa mani!

---

[english backtranslation goes here]

Now, having heard all that, I think you'll agree that [??]

The reason I put up this mini lesson is because _I_ was making this mistake with the word jan, not all that long ago.

In fact, you'll spot it in my main lessons!

I like to be clever and concise with the way I write my Toki Pona,
