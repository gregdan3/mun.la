<br/>

The opening to Conlang Critic is short, punchy, and comedic. Can we replicate
that in Toki Pona? Absolutely.

First, the original text:

> Welcome to Conlang Critic, the show that gets facts wrong about _your_
> favorite conlang!

And this is followed by jan Misali's self introduction.

## Specific translations

### Welcome

Welcomes are simple! They are usually expressed as an instruction using [o]{.tokipona},
and ended with [pona]{.tokipona} to express the well-wishing nature of the instruction.
Otherwise, a welcome is a kind of arrival, so we can use [kama]{.tokipona}: [o kama pona]{.tokipona}

You can also use the preposition [tawa]{.tokipona} to express where you're welcoming
somebody to, giving us [o kama pona tawa ...]{.tokipona}

### Conlang Critic

Conlang Critic could be a proper name by capitalizing it, or you could
translate it. In either case, jan Misali says it's a show, and a show is
entertainment, which is [musi]{.tokipona}. If you use a proper noun, your job is done here:
[musi]{.tokipona} (Conlang Critic), or whatever adaptation you prefer. You can do a little
better when you zoom in on "Conlang Critic" though!

### Conlangs

"Conlang," short for constructed language, could be described as both [pali]{.tokipona}
(creation) and [toki]{.tokipona} (language). This is an important decision when
deciding translations: which one is more important, and so becomes the head noun?
Here, we'll say that a constructed language is a "language" before it is
"constructed". But since both work, we use both words, and call it a [toki
pali]{.tokipona}

### Critics

As for "critic," we don't need to translate it as a single phrase. Critics do one
thing: talk about a subject. Let's make that a separate sentence! Our speaker
will refer to themselves with [mi]{.tokipona}, and will talk with [toki]{.tokipona}. Then, it is common to say you
talk "about" something using the preposition [lon]{.tokipona}: [jan li toki **lon** ijo]{.tokipona}.
There are more ways you could translate talking "about" something, but we'll stick with
[lon]{.tokipona}!

### Favorites

When describing their preferences, most speakers refer to things being [pona tawa mi]{.tokipona}, "good to me". Then, a favorite is often expressed as being "the most good", or
"first place" in goodness! With this, we can say that this is [nanpa wan]{.tokipona}, which can
apply to anything: [ni li pona nanpa wan tawa mi]{.tokipona}. So now we know our
critic will talk about [toki pali sina nanpa wan]{.tokipona}, your favorite conlang!

### Facts, Wrongness

Facts and wrongness often have to do with [lon]{.tokipona} and [lon ala]{.tokipona} respectively.
[lon]{.tokipona} deals with truth, so we could have our critic will speak in an untruthful
way: [toki pi lon ala]{.tokipona}. Let's try it!

## Putting it together

### Attempt #1

Here's the two halves of the opener we've made so far. Translations are under
the spoilers.

<details> 
  <summary> [o kama pona tawa musi mi! mi toki lon toki pali.]{.tokipona} </summary>

Welcome to my entertainment! I talk about created languages.

</details>

<details> 
  <summary> [toki sina nanpa wan la musi ni li toki pi lon ala!]{.tokipona} </summary>

In the context of your favorite language, this entertainment tells lies!

</details>

Looking good so far! You'll notice that in the second sentence, we refer to
only [toki sina nanpa wan]{.tokipona} instead of [toki pali sina nanpa wan]{.tokipona}. This is
because we've already introduced the fact that the critic is going to talk
about [toki pali]{.tokipona}. From there, it's clear that [toki]{.tokipona} alone refers back
to the same [toki pali]{.tokipona}.

Except there's still one problem: that's not quite the original meaning! [toki
pi lon ala]{.tokipona} definitely captures the idea of _lying_, but the statement actually
says they're getting facts _wrong_, jokingly, about your favorite conlang.
We've translated the idea of being wrong correctly; in the process, we've
translated it too literally. The intended meaning is about making mistakes,
which is more like [pakala]{.tokipona}! Let's try again:

### Attempt #2

The first half was already great, so here's the edited second half:

<details> 
  <summary> [toki sina nanpa wan la, musi ni li toki pakala!]{.tokipona} </summary>

In the context of your favorite language, this entertainment speaks mistakenly!

</details>

That's exactly what we want! It's short, punchy, and conveys the original humor as
faithfully as Toki Pona can do.

## Conclusion

The process of translation, especially into Toki Pona, can never be one-to-one.
You make compromises, subtle changes, and artistic and informational decisions
throughout an entire dialog. The skills that will help you most are
recognizing the objects and actions of a sentence, and breaking those down
individually without the rest of the sentence. This will get faster over time
too, until you're no longer thinking about it!
