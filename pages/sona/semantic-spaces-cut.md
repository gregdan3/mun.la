[TODO: cut whole section?]

There's another example like this one which is a _bit_ on the controversial side, so hold onto your butts. But uh, keep it respectful!

The word "unpa" is defined in Toki Pona: The Language of Good as "to have sexual or marital relations with".

lipu Linku disagrees with this second part: it only says "have sexual relations with." What happened here?

When Sonja originally defined unpa, she defined it partly literally, partly with a euphemism.

There were some people who learned toki pona, saw this, and didn't understand the euphemism as stated- so they took it literally, and used unpa to refer to marriage

But in the time between, the word unpa _has_ been used by some speakers to refer to acts of marriage- including what unpa is most commonly used for.

Alright, and as a treat, I'm also going to do one of these breakdowns _in toki pona._ Ready? Go!
