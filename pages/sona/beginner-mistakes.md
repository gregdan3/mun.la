## `seme` does not mean "question"

You cannot use "seme" as a content word. `seme` stands in for a statement you need information about.

## `ken la` doesn't _really_ mean "maybe"

Beginners are often taught that they can precede a statement with "ken la", and
this is roughly equivalent to saying "maybe". Interpreted literally, it would
be "In the context of possibility, ...". The mistake is when the same learner
takes "ken la" to be an _interjection_ meaning "maybe", which it is not!

"ken la" does _not_ mean "maybe"; it's "ken" with an unneeded grammatical
particle. If nothing follows it, the "la" doesn't mean anything.

To say "maybe" in response to a statement or question, "ken" is all you need.
