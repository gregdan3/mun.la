% Multiple li with sina with mi

## Uses

Most common format: extended li, where mi ... li means "mi [action] li [action]"

Secondary format, sometimes simultaneous with above: "mi [modifier] li [action]", meaning everything before mi is the subject

## Ambiguity

`mi [action] li [action]` and `mi [modifier] li [action]` can't be told apart except by context. Normally, Toki Pona's ambiguity comes from the words itself, and is more like vagueness. In this case, the syntax is actually ambiguous. Oops!

## Solutions

always use multiple sentences, so mi/sina never take multiple subjects

never do mi [action] li action
