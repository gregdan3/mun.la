Not many words this time! Instead, we'll be looking at a bunch of words from before in new ways.

## Overview

#### Interjections

In Toki Pona, there are many things to say that are not complete sentences: interjections! [toki]{.tokipona} says "hello", and a subject plus [o]{.tokipona} gets that subject's attention. But there's more!

Anything that can be a subject, predicate, object, or preposition with prep phrase can be an interjection! Some of these can even be used together.

But some words and phrases do better than others. To make this point, I've broken down interjections into a few common uses.

Before we start, let's talk about [a]{.tokipona}!

#### a, the interjection that ever

[a]{.tokipona} is a special word. It has no meaning like particles, but it also doesn't do anything to a sentence. It's just [a]{.tokipona}, and you use it to express your feelings! As a modifier, it makes the thing it modifies more intense like the word "very" in English. As an interjection, it works like a lot of wordless responses, such as "um," "oh," and "ah."

Since [a]{.tokipona} can be used so many ways, we'll look at a few examples to get a feel for it:

> [mi kama jo e lipu a]{.tokipona}
>
> > [a!]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

1: I got a cool book!

2: Ooooh! [excitement]

</details>

> [soweli mi li weka a]{.tokipona}
>
> > [a...]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

1: My dog ran away...

2: Oh... [empathy]

</details>

> [mi sona ala a e toki sina]{.tokipona}
>
> > [a...]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

1: I _really_ don't understand what you're saying

2: Hmmm... [thinking]

</details>

For all of these, the tone is important! Not everyone's tone will be the same when speaking, either. But this is far from everything that [a]{.tokipona} can do. Try lots of things!

::: info

Sometimes you'll hear "**nnn**" instead of "**aaa**". This comes from the word [n]{.tokipona}, which works like "hmm" or "uh" in English! It's less common than [a]{.tokipona}, so it is not in this lesson, but you may see and hear it around.

:::

#### o-alikes / well-wishes

[o]{.tokipona}-alikes are similar to instructions given with [o]{.tokipona}, but without [o]{.tokipona}. You could call them "well-wishes", because the most common of these end in or have [pona]{.tokipona}! Some examples:

<details><summary> [tawa pona]{.tokipona} </summary>

Go well!

Be happy as you leave!

</details>

<details><summary> [musi pona]{.tokipona} </summary>

Have fun!

Be happy as you play!

</details>

These two are similar: Do something in a good way! You'll see these used in response to goodbyes.

<details><summary> [pona tawa sina]{.tokipona} </summary>

Goodness, go to you!

Peace be upon you!

</details>

This one is also a well-wish, but includes the preposition [tawa]{.tokipona}.

You can choose to include [o]{.tokipona} where it makes sense, making these complete sentences while keeping the well-wishing meaning:

> [o tawa pona]{.tokipona}

> [o musi pona]{.tokipona}

> [pona o tawa sina]{.tokipona}

These versions could be instructions or well wishes. It's all about context!

Try lots of different things! Experimenting is key to speaking Toki Pona.

Here's an example exchange to fit the idea in a conversation:

> 1: [mi tawa]{.tokipona}
>
> > 2: [tawa pona]{.tokipona}
> >
> > > 1: [a・awen pona]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

1: I'm going!

2: Go well!

1: Yeah! Stay well!

---

The above is a literal translation, so here is a comparable conversation but written in more natural English:

1: I'm headed out!

2: See you later!

1: Yeah! See you!

</details>

#### Feelings, Opinions, and Remarks

Most other interjections are specific words! Their meaning as an interjection comes from what the word normally means. We already saw that [a]{.tokipona} can be used for any feeling, but words like [sona, wawa, musi,]{.tokipona} and others can do specific feelings: Excitement, interest, happiness, fear, anger, sadness, and everything between!

These can also be used to express how you feel about a situation, similar to saying "[ni li]{.tokipona} [word]", or "[pilin mi li]{.tokipona} [word]".

And they can be used to respond in a conversation!

Here's a bunch of common use examples. This is not a complete list, and it doesn't cover every way you could use these words. But it does cover a lot of common uses. Try lots of things!

---

[pona]{.tokipona} interjection is to express that something is good! It works like "great", "cool" or "nice" in English.

> [o pali e ni]{.tokipona}
>
> > [a・mi pali]{.tokipona}
> >
> > > [pona]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

1: Can you make this?

2: Yeah, I'll make it

1: Great, thanks!

</details>

---

[ike]{.tokipona} interjection is like saying "oh no" or "oof" in English, expressing your dislike for something.

> [mi ken ala kute e jan poka tan kalama suli... ike!]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

I can't hear the person beside me because of all the loud noise. Oh no!

</details>

---

[pakala]{.tokipona} interjection expresses your feelings about a mistake or accident, like saying "crud" or "oops" in English.

> [mi weka e lipu sona mi... pakala!]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

I lost my textbook. Crap!

</details>

---

[musi]{.tokipona} interjection is used to express excitement or humor! It can express the same feeling as laughter, but laughter itself is usually written with [a a a]{.tokipona}

> [jan tomo li toki e ni: mi pana ala tawa jan pi tawa tenpo... jan pi tawa tenpo li tawa tomo pi telo nasa.]{.tokipona}
>
> > [musi! a a a]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

1: "The bartender says this: I don't serve time travellers! A time traveller walks into a bar."

2: Hilarious! Hahahhaha

</details>

---

[suwi]{.tokipona} interjection is used to say that something is cute, soft, or sweet.

> [kala ni li suwi a・o lukin!]{.tokipona}
>
> > [a a a suwi]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

1: This fish is cute! Look!

2: Hahaha, it is cute!

</details>

[wawa]{.tokipona} interjection is used to express amazement and surprise, especially at the skill or strength of something.

> [mi suli e kulupu kasi mi lon tenpo lili taso]{.tokipona}
>
> > [wawa!]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

1: I made my garden grow big in only a little time!

2: Wow!

</details>

---

[sona]{.tokipona} interjection is used to express understanding of a previous statement, or to express that something is wise or smart!

> [sina ken kepeken ilo ni tawa pali tomo]{.tokipona}
>
> > [sona!]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

1: You can use this tool for building homes.

2: Got it!

</details>

---

[sama]{.tokipona} interjection is to say that you do or feel similarly to something that was previously stated.

> [pilin mi li musi a tan telo ni...]{.tokipona}
>
> > [sama]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

1: I'm feeling funny [in a humor way] because of this liquid!

2: Same!

</details>

---

[lon]{.tokipona} interjection is to indicate the truth of something. It's like saying "true" or "agreed" in English.

> [sina toki lon tenpo suli. sina ken lili e tenpo toki]{.tokipona}
>
> > [lon]{.tokipona}

<details><summary> See Translation! </summary>

1: You spoke for a long time. You can reduce the time you spend talking!

2: True.

</details>

::: info

Many interjections overlap in use! [pona]{.tokipona} and [lon]{.tokipona} can both positively acknowledge a statement. But they're not the same!

:::

[mu]{.tokipona} is Toki Pona's word for any animal sound- as an interjection, it tells you the speaker is having fun!

> [mu]{.tokipona}

---

Remember: this is not a complete list, but many examples. There are plenty words not on this list that work too! Here's even more rapid fire examples:

- [suli]{.tokipona} - Huuuuge!
- [lili]{.tokipona} - Tiny!
- [mute]{.tokipona} - So many!
- [seli]{.tokipona} - Hot!
- [lete]{.tokipona} - Cold!
- [jaki]{.tokipona} - Gross!
- [nasa]{.tokipona} - Weird!
- [ken]{.tokipona} - Maybe!

With the right context, any word can be used as an interjection in Toki Pona, so try lots of things!

## Exercises

Interjections are best understood as part of conversations, so the exercises are different for this lesson. The conversation will be shown above, and the translation will be in a spoiler below.

2: [a pona wawa!]{.tokipona}

::: info

The idea of a park being [ma musi]{.tokipona}, or the rain being [telo sewi]{.tokipona}, are not the only ways to do it! If you came up with something else, such as [ma kasi]{.tokipona} for park or [telo mute]{.tokipona} for rain, that's good too!

:::

</details>

> They broke my bike! I can't get home! Oh no!

[ona li pakala e ilo tawa mi! mi ken ala tawa tomi mi! ike! pakala!]{.tokipona}

1: [ona li jan pali pi kulupu pipi! ona li ni lon tenpo suli!]{.tokipona}

2: [suwi! pona mute a!]{.tokipona}

::: info

"Sweet" in English could be like "cool" and "awesome", or like "cute" and "adorable". It depends on if you're thinking of the excitement of beekeeping, or the adorable faces of bees. The Toki Pona translation does both, first cute then awesome!
