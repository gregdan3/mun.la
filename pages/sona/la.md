## Overview

::: info

Every example has more information than just a translation beneath! All of them include extra info on how to think about a certain phrase, what other ideas it is comparable to, and much more.

:::

#### Intro to la

[la]{.tokipona} is Toki Pona's most complex piece of grammar. But it's still simple like the rest of the language, so let's dig in!

First, [la]{.tokipona} is about context. When does something happen? What is it related to? [la]{.tokipona} tells you that when one thing is going on, another thing happens.

The thing before [la]{.tokipona} is a condition for the thing after it, like **if** and **then** working together in English. This may be a requirement, such as if the thing after [la]{.tokipona} _only_ happens when the thing before [la]{.tokipona} does! It can also be where, when, or why something happens, like prepositions. Sometimes, it can be two statements only related by happening at the same time! [la]{.tokipona} is very broad, but there are many useful patterns you can pick up on to better understand them.

When reading [la]{.tokipona} phrases, it's helpful to think of them like this:

> **[1] [la]{.tokipona} [2]**

---

> In the context of **[1]**, **[2]**

> If **[1]**, then **[2]**

> Because of **[1]**, **[2]** happens.

Keep these shorthands in mind as we explore the different ways [la]{.tokipona} can be used!

#### Phrases and la

::: info

Feel free to skip around! There are many examples here, each with different perspectives on how [la]{.tokipona} works. But be sure to read them all by the end!

:::

---

##### la and perspective

The context could be a subject or object, such as a person or thing. This is useful for discussing perspective, like the preposition [tawa]{.tokipona}:

<details><summary> [mi la sina sewi lon utala!]{.tokipona} </summary>

To me, you'll win in the fight!

In my opinion, you're going to win the competition!

::: info

Here is a restatement using **[tawa]{.tokipona}**:

[sina sewi lon utala tawa mi]{.tokipona}

:::

</details>

Here, the [la]{.tokipona} phrase has [mi]{.tokipona} in it- this could mean "in my opinion" or "in my perspective". [mi]{.tokipona} being context for the rest of the sentence is a way of saying that something is relevant to the speaker- relevant to you! Check under the spoiler for your understanding.

---

##### la and location

But the context isn't limited to people or things- it can also be places, like with the preposition [lon]{.tokipona}:

<details><summary> [sewi la sina ken lukin e suno mute]{.tokipona} </summary>

In the sky, you can see many lanterns!

In the rafters, you can see lots of lights.

::: info

Here's a restatement that uses **[lon]{.tokipona}**:

[sina ken lukin e suno mute lon sewi]{.tokipona}

:::

</details>

Here, [sewi]{.tokipona} is the context. Since [sewi]{.tokipona} is often a location, this could refer to where something happens, or where something is! This isn't the only interpretation though. Check under the spoiler!

---

##### la and cause

The context could be an action or idea too, and refer to cause and effect like the preposition [tan]{.tokipona}:

<details><summary> [pali sina la jan mute li kama pona]{.tokipona} </summary>

You worked, so people healed!

Because of your work, many people have gotten better.

::: info

This is similar to using **[tan]{.tokipona}**!

[jan mute li kama pona tan pali sina]{.tokipona}

:::

</details>

Here, the context [pali]{.tokipona} is an action- working or creating. The [la]{.tokipona} phrase refers to cause: [pali]{.tokipona} must happen for everything else to happen! Even this works like one of the prepositions- **most phrases in [la]{.tokipona} work like one of the prepositions**! This doesn't work every time, but it can help your understanding go far!

---

##### la and description

The context in [la]{.tokipona} could be a description, which is especially useful for contrast:

<details><summary> [laso la kasi li pilin pona. loje la kasi li kama moli.]{.tokipona} </summary>

When green, plants feel good. When red/brown, plants die.

Green plants are healthy. Red plants are dying.

::: info

Contrast is one of the most important ways to express complex ideas in Toki Pona!

:::

</details>

Here, two contexts are used in separate sentences to explain a deeper idea! They each give context for their respective sentences, and together give more information than either one alone. The first sentence uses [laso]{.tokipona}: "If green, then...", and that is contrasted with [loje]{.tokipona}: "If red, then..."
Check under the spoiler for the translation!

::: info

Fun fact: these sentences are the least like the prepositions. Instead, these sentences have context that works a lot like **modifiers**!

:::

---

##### la and feelings

Sometimes, the context will be the speaker's opinion or feelings about the main sentence, like an interjection:

<details><summary> [ike la soweli mi li moku e lipu sona mi!]{.tokipona} </summary>

Unfortunately, my dog ate my homework!

Upsetting! My cats chewed up my textbook!

::: info

Here's another version with [ike]{.tokipona} as an interjection:

[ike! soweli mi li moku e lipu sona mi!]{.tokipona}

:::

</details>

And here, the context [ike]{.tokipona} tells us how the speaker feels about the statement. It's like an interjection!

---

##### la and meaning

Sometimes, it won't be clear what the context is when you hear it. It could be a place, object, action, description, or many more things- and that's okay!

<details><summary> [utala la mi pana e kiwen!]{.tokipona} </summary>

- In a fight, I threw a rock!
- In the context of fighting, I give a rock.

::: info

The context completely changes the interpretation here! Without [utala]{.tokipona}, most listeners wouldn't assume the rock is being thrown. With it, this is a fight!

:::

</details>

Here, [utala]{.tokipona} works like a location, idea, or action depending on perspective. This is all about interpretation, but the result is the same: the main sentence happens in the context of a fight!

---

##### la and whole prepositions

Lastly, you can have any full prepositional phrase in [la]{.tokipona}! This is the same as having that phrase at the end of the sentence, how we learned it before:

<details><summary> [lon tomo la mi lape]{.tokipona} </summary>

In a home, I sleep.

::: info

Here's the same statement without [la]{.tokipona}!

[mi lape lon tomo]{.tokipona}

:::

</details>

This is exactly the same as having the preposition at the end of the sentence- so why would you use it? For style, for fun, maybe because it feels more clear! This is a choice you have more than anything else.

<!-- We noted before that [la]{.tokipona} phrases often work like prepositions, even without the preposition itself. But for clarity, you can include the preposition itself in the [la]{.tokipona} phrase to the same effect!  -->
<!---->

Because so many [la]{.tokipona} phrases are similar to prepositional phrases, you can often drop the preposition itself and have the same meaning as with it. This especially applies to [lon]{.tokipona} and [tawa]{.tokipona}, and sometimes [tan]{.tokipona} and [kepeken]{.tokipona}.

> [tomo la mi lape]{.tokipona}

This restatement without [lon]{.tokipona} _can_ mean the same as the above example!

Notably, [sama]{.tokipona} phrases won't usually mean the same thing if you drop the preposition.

<details><summary> [sama kasi la mi awen lon ma]{.tokipona} </summary>

Like plants, I stay still on the ground.

::: info

Here's the same statement without [la]{.tokipona}!

[mi awen lon ma sama kasi]{.tokipona}

:::

</details>

[sama]{.tokipona} needs its preposition to be understood, but [sama]{.tokipona} prep phrases can still be used in [la]{.tokipona}!

::: warning

Be careful- not using the preposition can introduce other interpretations! Be ready to restate yourself if somebody isn't sure what you mean!

:::

#### Phrases and la summary

That was a lot of information! Let's take a moment to review everything so far.

Think back to the start of the lesson, and this example of how [la]{.tokipona} could be interpreted:

> In the context of **[1]**, **[2]**

When [la]{.tokipona} has a phrase, it works most like this. Look back over the examples, and see how often this applies!

Otherwise, any valid phrase may be before [la]{.tokipona}, and those phrases can act like almost any part of speech or function in Toki Pona! In short, the context can be any almost anything, so experiment!

<!---->
<!-- Parts of speech: -->
<!---->
<!-- - Subjects: people, places, things -->
<!-- - Predicates: actions, descriptions -->
<!-- - Objects: people, places, things like Subjects -->
<!-- - Prepositional phrases, sometimes without the preposition -->

These prepositional meanings are most common when [la]{.tokipona} has a phrase. The other uses, such as cause and effect, are still possible with phrases before [la]{.tokipona}. But cause and effect is most often expressed with **full sentences** before la, which are next!

#### Sentences and la

[la]{.tokipona} has one more important use: you can use a full sentence for context!

::: warning

**Terminology note!** When I use "sentence" in this section, I mean **statements before and after [la]{.tokipona}**. Here's an example of each sentence underlined: [<u>sina pona</u> la <u>mi pona</u>]{.tokipona}.

You might see "sentence" used to refer to a complete statement including [la]{.tokipona}- that's valid too, so be aware!

:::

When you have a full sentence, it can express anything- so instead of breaking down many possibilities like I did with phrases, we'll work through several examples and build an understanding. Let's get started!

---

<details><summary> [sina pona la mi pona]{.tokipona} </summary>

- If you're good, I'm good!
- When you're well, I'm well!
- You're happy, so I'm happy!

</details>

Here, the context is ["sina pona"]{.tokipona}, which you understand by now! The main sentence is ["mi pona"]{.tokipona}, and you know that too! But with [la]{.tokipona} between them, the meaning of the second sentence now depends on the first. You might say, "if [sina pona]{.tokipona}, then [mi pona]{.tokipona}". Check your understanding in the spoiler!

<!-- You can have any kind of sentence before [la]{.tokipona}, so here's a few other examples out of the different sentences we've seen so far! -->

---

<details><summary> [jan li pona la mi wile lon poka ona]{.tokipona} </summary>

- If people are good, I want to be at their side.
- When people are good, I want to be close to them.
- People are good, so I want to be near them.

</details>

This is a bit more complex! Now we have a sentence with [li]{.tokipona}, but that's okay. We note that [ona]{.tokipona} in the later sentence refers back to [jan]{.tokipona} in the first, and we can once again imagine the two working together like "if" and "then" in English. Here's a similar example with "so": [jan li pona]{.tokipona}, so [mi wile lon poka ona]{.tokipona}. Check the spoiler!

---

<details><summary> [kasi li moku e telo la ona li kama suli]{.tokipona} </summary>

- The flowers drank water, so they became tall!
- If the trees consumed water, they will be huge!
- If the plant drinks water, it will grow big!

</details>

Here, we have a statement with [e]{.tokipona} before [la]{.tokipona}. It doesn't matter how complex the sentence before [la]{.tokipona} gets- the sentence after will still depend on the one before! But at this point, you should be comfortable with sentences like these.

---

<details><summary> [ona li tawa tomo la ona li kama wile lape]{.tokipona} </summary>

- When they're traveling home, they get tired!
- While they're going home, they want to sleep!
- When they left for home, they needed to sleep.

</details>

Sentences before [la]{.tokipona} work the same with prepositions, pre-preds, and any other part of speech or function. Like I said, these are normal sentences, with all the same rules we've learned.

---

<details><summary> [sina kama kala la sina tawa telo]{.tokipona} </summary>

- If you became a mermaid, you would swim!
- When you're a whale, you travel in the water.
- If you were a fish, you'd go to the water.

</details>

If you remember back to the early lessons, there was a suggestion to ignore parts of the sentence, read what is left, then add back the ignored part. For example, with modifiers, you could look at only the first word, and go back for the modifier(s). You can do this with [la]{.tokipona} too, but unlike modifiers which only get more specific, [la]{.tokipona} changes the sentence. You'll need it! Still, this strategy can help you.

::: info

There's a million different ways to express a sentence before [la]{.tokipona}- I can't cover them all! But trust that, if you understand the sentences before and after [la]{.tokipona}, you can figure out what they mean with [la]{.tokipona} between!

:::

By the way- sentences can get complex, both before and after [la]{.tokipona}! It's generally better to break down speech into more sentences, but you can still have complex ones, so here's a really involved example:

<details><summary> [jan li alasa e kiwen wawa lon tenpo suno ale la ona li pakala e ilo mute li kama wile pali ala]{.tokipona} </summary>

- When somebody pans for gold all day, they'll break lots of pans, and want to give up
- If everyone is looking for iron while the sun is out, they'll break their pickaxes and want to stop trying so hard!
- The people were hunting for tungsten every day, so they broke their drills and wanted to quit!
- People are searching for strong rocks the whole day, then they broke their tools and wanted to stop working

::: warning

All these different interpretations are just because of interpreting Toki Pona in English- the Toki Pona would only mean one thing in one context!

:::

</details>

There's a lot going on here! An action, a time that action happens, and the effect of that action on the subject! The sentence before [la]{.tokipona} describes a circumstance- what happened before, what will happen, or a hypothetical situation that could happen. The sentence after describes what that circumstance causes. Interpret each individually, then connect them as though "if" and "then" were used. Check under the spoiler for your understanding!

#### Sentences and la summary

Think to the start of the lesson again:

> If **[1]**, then **[2]**

When [la]{.tokipona} has a sentence, it most often works like this! The sentence before [la]{.tokipona} is what causes the sentence after [la]{.tokipona} to happen.

You can often interpret each sentence individually, then figure out what they mean together from that! And this generally expresses cause and effect.

#### Other uses of la

##### Multiple la

You can have multiple consecutive [la]{.tokipona} phrases, but keep them short for clarity:

<details><summary> [ken la mi kama jo e ilo musi mute la mi ken pana e ona tawa jan poka mi!]{.tokipona} </summary>

Maybe, if I get lots of fun toys, I can give them to my friends!

If possible, I will get several game consoles, and gift them to my neighbors!

</details>

You'll notice that one of the phrases is just a word, and the other is a sentence. Mixing the two is totally fine!

<details><summary> [sina pali la, sona mi la, sina ken ni!]{.tokipona} </summary>

If you work, then to my understanding, you can do this!

</details>

Here, the phrase and sentence are in the opposite order. Just as well!

::: warning

It might be that both contexts apply to the last "main" sentence, or that the first applies to the second and the second applies to the last sentence. [Like when we learned about [pi]{.tokipona}](./mod-pi.md), context matters- but shorter sentences, and fewer phrases, are clearer!

:::

<!-- ::: warning -->
<!---->
<!-- You can have any number of [la]{.tokipona} phrases, but most speakers will stick to one. This is a cultural thing- you can have more, but we've found one to be the most clear! -->
<!---->
<!-- ::: -->

##### if la, then o

You can combine [la]{.tokipona} with [o]{.tokipona} to make your instructions conditional. Here it works with a sentence:

<details><summary> [sina lukin e kasi suli la o tawa nasin kiwen. nasin li tawa kulupu tomo]{.tokipona} </summary>

When you see the tall trees, travel down the rocky road. The road goes to the city!

If you see tall trees, take the gravel path. The path takes you to the village!

</details>

These are the same as the **if [1], then [2]** way to interpret. But now, the "then" part is **then do [2]**!

It works with a phrase too, but it can be a bit less clear what you mean. Try this one out:

<details><summary> [tenpo poka la poki kasi o lon supa]{.tokipona} </summary>

Soon, the flower pot must be on the table.

</details>

Sentences are often more clear than phrases because they provide more information about when or why you should do something- still, experiment! Clever, brief statements can convey a ton of info.

## Takeaway

Here's something important about this entire lesson, exercises and all: the way I described [la]{.tokipona} here is by no means perfect. It's not the only way you can think about how [la]{.tokipona} works, and it's not necessarily the best way- this is a breakdown of how I see and teach this part of Toki Pona's grammar. You'll get different explanations from other speakers- so the best you can hope for is to have a good idea in mind that gets you close to right! And you'll know you're there when you read and understand the sentence.

Either way, the raw grammar still applies, and so do all these provided translations!

#### Summary

As a short review, [la]{.tokipona} comes in two forms:

- Incomplete sentences, as in phrases and individual words. Most often these are interpreted as "in the context of **[1]**, **[2]**". They can also convey condition like modifiers, or circumstance like prepositions!
- Complete sentences, which can be as long and complex as any sentence without [la]{.tokipona}! These are often conditional, interpreted as "if **[1]**, then **[2]**".

This is a complete list of everything [la]{.tokipona} does grammatically, but not everything it can do in meaning. Also, all the given English interpretations are only approximations of how [la]{.tokipona} really works, and aren't perfect.

#### la and expression

[la]{.tokipona} makes Toki Pona come alive with meaning and expression! So many new and unique things can be said with [la]{.tokipona}, it's hard to imagine Toki Pona without this piece of grammar. You can describe circumstance, context, cause and effect, everything a preposition can do, and more.

#### What if I don't get it?

If you're ever confused by another speaker's statement, try asking them what's up with **Questions** in the next lesson:

> [sina toki e ni lon poka pi nimi 'la': ... ni li toki e seme?]{.tokipona}

And while you're at it, don't worry about not getting [la]{.tokipona} yet. Most speakers say it took them the most time to understand [la]{.tokipona} compared to all the other words and grammar. If you keep trying, you'll get it!
