## Overview

#### Intro to la

[la]{.tokipona} is Toki Pona's most complex piece of grammar. But it's still simple like the rest of the language, so let's dig in!

First, [la]{.tokipona} is about context. When does something happen? What is it related to? [la]{.tokipona} tells you that when one thing is going on, another thing is too!

The thing before [la]{.tokipona} is a condition for the thing after it, like **if** and **then** working together in English. This may be a requirement, such as if the thing after [la]{.tokipona} _only_ happens when the thing before [la]{.tokipona} does! It can also be where or when something happens, which isn't required, just helpful.

When reading [la]{.tokipona} phrases, it's helpful to think of them like this:

> **[1] [la]{.tokipona} [2]**

---

> In the context of **[1]**, **[2]**

> If **[1]**, then **[2]**

> Because of **[1]**, **[2]** happens.

#### Phrases and la

The context could be a subject or object, such as a person, place, or thing:

<details><summary> [mi la sina sewi lon utala!]{.tokipona} </summary>

To me, you'll win in the fight!

In my opinion, you're going to win the competition!

::: info

This is similar to using **[tawa]{.tokipona}**!

[sina sewi lon utala tawa mi]{.tokipona}

:::

</details>

<details><summary> [sewi la sina ken lukin e suno mute]{.tokipona} </summary>

Up, you're able to observe the lanterns

In the sky, you can see many lights!

::: info

This is similar to using **[lon]{.tokipona}**!

[sina ken lukin e suno mute lon sewi]{.tokipona}

:::

</details>

The context could be an action or idea too:

<details><summary> [pali sina la jan mute li kama pona]{.tokipona} </summary>

You worked, so people healed!

Because of your work, many people have gotten better.

::: info

This is similar to using **[tan]{.tokipona}**!

[jan mute li kama pona tan pali sina]{.tokipona}

:::

</details>

<details><summary> [utala la mi pana e kiwen!]{.tokipona} </summary>

- In a fight, I threw a rock!
- In the context of fighting, I give a rock.

::: info

The context completely changes the interpretation here! Without [utala]{.tokipona}, this is just gifting a rock. With it, this is a real fight!

:::

</details>

It could be a description:

<details><summary> [laso la, kasi li pilin pona. loje la, kasi li kama moli.]{.tokipona} </summary>

When green, plants feel good. When red or brown, plants die.

Green plants are healthy. Red plants are dying.

::: info

Contrast is one of the most important ways to express complex ideas in Toki Pona!

:::

</details>

<details><summary> [ike la soweli mi li moku e lipu sona mi!]{.tokipona} </summary>

Unfortunately, my dog ate my homework!

Upsetting! My cats chewed up my textbook!

::: info

Here, the description works a lot like an interjection!

[ike! soweli mi li moku e lipu sona mi!]{.tokipona}

:::

</details>

Or it could be any prepositional phrase, which is the same as having that phrase at the end of the sentence:

<details><summary> [lon tomo la mi lape]{.tokipona} </summary>

In a home, I sleep.

::: info

Here's the same statement without [la]{.tokipona}!

[mi lape lon tomo]{.tokipona}

:::

</details>

<details><summary> [sama kasi la mi awen lon ma]{.tokipona} </summary>

Like plants, I stay still on the ground.

::: info

Here's the same statement without [la]{.tokipona}!

[mi awen lon ma sama kasi]{.tokipona}

:::

</details>

You can sometimes drop the preposition itself and be understood the same, too. This works best with [lon]{.tokipona} and [tawa]{.tokipona}, and sometimes with [tan]{.tokipona} and [kepeken]{.tokipona}. But be careful- some of these restatements introduce other interpretations too!

#### Phrases and la summary

Think back to the start of the lesson, and this example:

> In the context of **[1]**, **[2]**

When [la]{.tokipona} has a phrase, it works most like this. Look back over the examples, and see how often this applies!

Otherwise, any valid phrase may be before [la]{.tokipona}, and those phrases can act like almost any part of speech or function in Toki Pona! In short, the context can be any almost anything, so experiment!

<!---->
<!-- Parts of speech: -->
<!---->
<!-- - Subjects: people, places, things -->
<!-- - Predicates: actions, descriptions -->
<!-- - Objects: people, places, things like Subjects -->
<!-- - Prepositional phrases, sometimes without the preposition -->

The other interpretations, such as cause and effect, are still possible with phrases before [la]{.tokipona}. But cause and effect is most often expressed with full sentences before la, which are next!

#### Sentences and la

[la]{.tokipona} has one more important use: you can use a full sentence for context!

<details><summary> [sina pona la mi pona]{.tokipona} </summary>

- If you're good, I'm good!
- When you're well, I'm well!
- You're happy, so I'm happy!

</details>

<details><summary> [jan li pona la, mi wile lon poka ona]{.tokipona} </summary>

- If people are good, I want to be at their side.
- When people are good, I want to be close to them.
- People are good, so I want to be near them.

</details>

Most sentences can go before [la]{.tokipona}, even if they're complex!

<details><summary> [jan li alasa e kiwen wawa lon tenpo suno ale la ona li wile lape]{.tokipona} </summary>

- When somebody pans for gold all day, they want to sleep!
- If everyone is looking for iron while the sun is out, they'll want to go to bed!
- The people were hunting for tungsten every day, so they want to sleep!

</details>

<details><summary> []{.tokipona} </summary>

</details>

You can combine [la]{.tokipona} with [o]{.tokipona} to make your instructions conditional:

<details><summary> [sina lukin e kasi suli la o tawa nasin kiwen. nasin li tawa kulupu tomo]{.tokipona} </summary>

When you see the tall trees, travel down the rocky road. The road goes to the city!

If you see tall trees, take the gravel path. The path takes you to the village!

</details>

<details><summary> []{.tokipona} </summary>

</details>

And you can have multiple consecutive [la]{.tokipona} phrases, but keep them short for clarity:

<details><summary> [ken la mi kama jo e ilo musi mute la mi ken pana e ona tawa jan poka mi!]{.tokipona} </summary>

Maybe, if I get lots of fun toys, I can give them to my friends!

If possible, I will get several game consoles, and gift them to my neighbors!

</details>

#### Sentences and la summary

Think to the start of the lesson again:

> If **[1]**, then **[2]**

When [la]{.tokipona} has a sentence, it most often works like this!

#### Cool Tricks

::: info

This is a bunch of extra knowledge, helpful ways to use [la]{.tokipona} that can help you think about how it works in Toki Pona! It isn't required, and if you're not interested, skip ahead to [the exercises](#exercises)

:::

##### Comparisons with la

Back in the [prepositions lesson](./preps.html), we learned several ways to make comparisons using [tawa]{.tokipona} and [sama]{.tokipona}! [la]{.tokipona}, especially with a phrase, gives us a few more useful comparisons!

<details><summary> [tomo la tomo ni li lili]{.tokipona} </summary>

This house is small compared to other houses.

In the context of buildings, this building is tiny.

To other rooms, this room is too little!

</details>

This works very similarly to [tawa]{.tokipona}, for the same reason we described before

##### Avoiding an extra "pi"

Remember way back in the [modifiers lesson](./mod-pi.html) when we learned about [pi]{.tokipona} and using only one at a time? If you've been practicing since then, you might have noticed that two [pi]{.tokipona} phrases can be hard to avoid sometimes. But [la]{.tokipona} can help!

Take the following sentence for example:

<details><summary>[pali lipu pi jan pi pana sona li wawa]{.tokipona}</summary>

The work of the teacher's book is so much!

</details>

This is grammatical, but it's a bit messy with two [pi]{.tokipona} phrases used! We can restate it with more sentences:

<details><summary>[jan pi pana sona li jo e lipu. lipu li jo e pali. pali lipu li wawa.]{.tokipona}</summary>

The teacher has a book. The book has work. The work of the book is a lot.

</details>

And this cleans up our grammar problems! But it's still really wordy, right? Let's get clever:

<details><summary>[jan pi pana sona li jo e lipu. pali lipu li wawa.]{.tokipona}</summary>

The teacher has a book. The book's work is difficult.

</details>

Here, we skip introducing the idea of the [lipu]{.tokipona} having [pali]{.tokipona}, and instead just imply it. Nice! But can we do better?

<details><summary>[jan pi pana sona la pali pi lipu ona li wawa]{.tokipona}</summary>
</details>

Here's the trick: a phrase in [la]{.tokipona} can be referenced with [ni]{.tokipona} or [ona]{.tokipona} as appropriate, which makes the grammatical flow of a sentence cleaner!

<details><summary> See the various interpretations! </summary>

- The work of the teacher's book is so much!
- The teacher has a book. The book has work. The work of the book is a lot.
- The teacher's book has a lot of complex work!

</details>

## Takeaway

#### la and expression

[la]{.tokipona} makes Toki Pona's expressivity come alive! So many new expressions are possible with it, it's hard to imagine Toki Pona without this piece of grammar. You can describe context, cause and effect, and everything a preposition can do.

As a short review, [la]{.tokipona} comes in two forms:

- Incomplete sentences, as in phrases and individual words. Most often these are interpreted as "in the context of [before la], [after la]". They can also convey condition, or circumstance!
- Complete sentences, which can get complex and long! These are often conditional, interpreted as "if [before la], then [after la]".

  these are much more frequently some kind of conditional, but they can just be context too. this one is a conditional:
  "if people are good, I want to be at their side"

but! don't worry much about not getting la yet! it is the most complex part of toki pona's grammar, and while that isn't saying much, it is still nuanced. it probably took me two months of regular practice to really feel like i understood la.
