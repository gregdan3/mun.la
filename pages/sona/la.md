## Overview

#### Intro to la

[la]{.tokipona} is Toki Pona's most complex piece of grammar. But this isn't saying much, because it is simple like the rest of the language!

[la]{.tokipona} is a conditional. Anything that goes before it is a condition for anything that goes after it, a bit like "if" and "then" working together in English.

Interpreting a [la]{.tokipona} phrase works like these:

> In the context of [thing before [la]{.tokipona}], [thing after [la]{.tokipona}]

> If [thing before [la]{.tokipona}], then [thing after [la]{.tokipona}]

> Because of [thing before [la]{.tokipona}], [thing after [la]{.tokipona}] happens.

#### Phrases and la

The context could be a subject or object, such as a person, place, or thing:

<details><summary> []{.tokipona} </summary>

</details>

<details><summary> []{.tokipona} </summary>

</details>

The context could be an action:

<details><summary> [pali sina la jan mute li kama pona]{.tokipona} </summary>

Because of your work, many people have gotten better.

::: info

This is similar to using **tan**!

[jan mute li kama pona tan pali sina]{.tokipona}

:::

</details>

<details><summary> []{.tokipona} </summary>

</details>

It could be a description:

<details><summary> []{.tokipona} </summary>

</details>

<details><summary> []{.tokipona} </summary>

</details>

Or it could be any prepositional phrase, which is the same as having that phrase at the end of the sentence:

<details><summary> [lon tomo la mi lape]{.tokipona} </summary>

In a home, I sleep.

</details>

<details><summary> []{.tokipona} </summary>

</details>

Using [la]{.tokipona} you can even drop the preposition itself and be understood the same. This works best with [lon]{.tokipona}, and to a smaller extent [tan]{.tokipona} and [kepeken]{.tokipona}. Look back at the examples above- there are extra notes for which ones are similar to prepositions!

In short, the context can be any valid phrase from the subject, predicate, object, or prepositional phrase.

#### Sentences and la

[la]{.tokipona} has one more important use: you can use a full sentence for context!

<details><summary> []{.tokipona} </summary>

</details>

<details><summary> []{.tokipona} </summary>

</details>

You can combine [la]{.tokipona} with [o]{.tokipona} to make your instructions conditional:

<details><summary> []{.tokipona} </summary>

</details>

<details><summary> []{.tokipona} </summary>

</details>

## Takeaway

la is providing context, and it comes in two forms

1. incomplete sentences (phrases, individual words):
   pona la mi pini e pali mi
   these can be conditional but more frequently are more like the literal interpretation: in the context of (before la), (after la)
   so here, this is like "in the context of good, I finish my work"

2. complete sentences:
   jan li pona la, mi wile lon poka ona
   these are much more frequently some kind of conditional, but they can just be context too. this one is a conditional:
   "if people are good, I want to be at their side"

but! don't worry much about not getting la yet! it is the most complex part of toki pona's grammar, and while that isn't saying much, it is still nuanced. it probably took me two months of regular practice to really feel like i understood la.
