### Words to Know

All new words will be separated into categories!

#### Particles

Particles are for grammar. They are used for sentence structure, introducing new parts of a sentence. Most do not have meanings, only functions.

::: tpdefinitions

| Glyph | Word | Use                                          |
| ----- | ---- | -------------------------------------------- |
| li    | li   | (mark a predicate; begin a predicate phrase) |

:::

#### Content Words

Content words have meaning, and can be in both the subject and predicate, plus others we'll see later!

::: tpdefinitions

| Glyph  | Word   | Definition                                    |
| ------ | ------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| kasi   | kasi   | plant, flower, tree, vegetation               |
| kiwen  | kiwen  | rock, hard, tough, sturdy, durable            |
| ko     | ko     | dust, goop, clay, paste, squishy thing        |
| telo   | telo   | liquid, water, fluid                          |
| kulupu | kulupu | group, collection, nation, community          |
| jaki   | jaki   | gross, garbage, trash, sick                   |
| wawa   | wawa   | power, strength, courage, energy, electricity |
| suwi   | suwi   | sweet, soft, fluffy, cute, fragrant           |
| nasa   | nasa   | strange, weird, silly, rare                   |
| seli   | seli   | hot, fire, warm, hot object                   |

The words from the last lesson were content words too!

## Overview

#### Predicates and li

The next type of Toki Pona sentence is a simple but powerful addition!

> [subject] [li]{.tokipona} [predicate]

With this sentence, you can talk about things other than yourself and your listener. While [li]{.tokipona} is present, any word but [mi]{.tokipona} and [sina]{.tokipona} can be in the subject, and any word can be in the predicate like in last lesson. You'll find that the variety in Toki Pona words lets you say a lot, even with so few words!

<details> <summary> A note on "any word" </summary>

I do say "any word", but clever observers will have noticed I am treating the word [li]{.tokipona} differently. It is introduced as a particle, its definition is given in parentheses, and it is treated as a grammatical structure instead of as a word. This is because [li]{.tokipona} cannot be used in the subject or predicate, with some subtle exceptions we'll get to later. For now, everything _else_ can be in the subject or predicate.

</details>

Since using [li]{.tokipona} lets you put any word in the subject, most of the words in the lesson before can now be used there! This leans heavily into the action/description duality described before. Unlike that duality, you can tell which sense a word is meant in based on its place in a sentence. Words in the subject are more likely to be specific objects or ideas, where words in the predicate are more likely to be actions or descriptions!

::: warning

Remember, if the subject is _just_ [mi]{.tokipona} or _just_ [sina]{.tokipona}, do not include [li]{.tokipona}!

:::

Here's a guided example:

<details> <summary> [mama li musi]{.tokipona} </summary>

- Mom is hilarious.
- Dad is being funny.
- My parent is exciting!
- My babysitter is amusing!
- Grandpa is joking.

</details>

Here, the subject is [mama]{.tokipona}, a parent or ancestor. Since the subject isn't [mi]{.tokipona} or [sina]{.tokipona}, [li]{.tokipona} is present and starts the predicate. Then the predicate is [musi]{.tokipona}, fun and entertainment.
[musi]{.tokipona} could be either a description or action here, and these cannot be told apart without more context. Check under the spoiler for possible interpretations!

#### Multiple li

To say a subject does more than one thing, you say [li]{.tokipona} again, making another predicate. Saying [li]{.tokipona} multiple times is like saying "and" in English! Here's another example:

<details> <summary> [kulupu li suli li pona]{.tokipona} </summary>

- The community is huge, and wonderful!
- The collection is enormous, and pretty!
- The stack is tall, and fantastic!

</details>

Here, the subject [kulupu]{.tokipona} is doing two different things: being [suli]{.tokipona} (big) and being [pona]{.tokipona} (good).

<details> <summary> [jan li tawa li lape]{.tokipona} </summary>

- The person walks, and goes to sleep.
- The person walks, and sleeps.
- Everyone is traveling, and sleeping.

</details>

Here, [jan]{.tokipona} is doing two different things: [tawa]{.tokipona} (moving), and [lape]{.tokipona} (sleeping). Toki Pona words don't mark time, so these two actions can happen at different times!

You can have as many predicates as you want, but try to keep your sentences shorter- shorter sentences are easier to understand.

::: warning

[mi]{.tokipona} and [sina]{.tokipona} do not take [li]{.tokipona}, so you can't _normally_ do this with [mi]{.tokipona} and [sina]{.tokipona}. Instead, use separate sentences: [mi tawaãƒ»mi lape]{.tokipona}

## Exercises

### Toki Pona to English

#### Single li

You and a friend are looking through old photos. Your friend points to one of a person leaning against a wall, smiling wide at the camera and says:

A group of friends is at the side of a pool. All of them stare into the water, unsure whether they are ready to brave it. Suddenly, one friend cannonballs into the water, splashing everyone. When they surface, they yell:

You're on an expedition to see the tallest tree in the world. You've walked for hours upon hours, sweating heavily under the sun. You hike to the peak of one more hill, and spot the tree on the horizon. You can see it from miles away! You shout:

On an epic quest, you stop at a wizard's tower and climb it. At the top, the wizard is deep in research. He teaches you a new spell to aid your journey: Spoonform. With this power, you can turn into a spoon for a short time. You don't tell the wizard, but you think to yourself:

<details> <summary> [wawa li nasa]{.tokipona} </summary>

Magic is ridiculous!

---

- Power is absurd.
- Strength is odd.
- Confidence is confusing.

</details>

While visiting your grandmother's house, she offers you piles of different sweets! You try each and every one, enjoying the smell and taste of your grandmother's wonderful cooking. Your most favorite was her apple pie- thinking about it again, you think to yourself:

Pie is sweet!

---

- The food is sweet
- The water is sugary

The sand is hot!

---

- The tar is on fire!
- The dough is warming.

## Takeaway

#### Grammar

In the previous lesson, we covered a sentence which exclusively began with either [mi]{.tokipona} or [sina]{.tokipona}. In this lesson, we covered a sentence where anything can start the sentence- so long as it is followed by [li]{.tokipona}. In fact, these are the same kind of sentence!

> [[mi]{.tokipona}/[sina]{.tokipona}] [predicate]

> [subject] [li]{.tokipona} [predicate]

Another way to think about this sentence is this: if the subject is _exactly_ [mi]{.tokipona} or _exactly_ [sina]{.tokipona}, don't include [li]{.tokipona}.

#### Content Words and Particles

Any _meaningful_ word may appear in either the subject, the predicate, or both at once. When I say "meaningful", this refers the idea of a **content word**, or a word which serves some _semantic_ function instead of an exclusively grammatical one. The word [li]{.tokipona} is only grammatical- it is not a content word. Every other word so far is a content word.

The word [li]{.tokipona} is a **particle**, and is not the only one! We will learn about the rest in future lessons. What they have in common is having no semantic function- no meaning.

There are also a handful of words which are so-called **pseudo-particles**. This category is more blurry, but it contains words which have functions as particles _and_ as content words.
