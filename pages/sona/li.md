## Words to Know

New lesson means new ideas: Word will now be split into categories, based on how
they work in a sentence!

### Particles

Particles are for grammar. They are used for sentence structure, introducing new
parts of a sentence. Most do not have meanings, only functions.

|                 Word                  | Use                                          | Writing                |
| :-----------------------------------: | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| [li]{.glyph}<br/>[li]{.glyphsubtitle} | (mark a predicate; begin a predicate phrase) | One right-facing arrow |

### Content Words

Content words have meaning, and can be used most places in a sentence! So far,
that's just the subject and predicate, but we'll grow that list after this
lesson! Aside: All the words from the last lesson were content words too!

|                     Word                      | Definition                                    | Writing                                                                        |
| :-------------------------------------------: | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   [kasi]{.glyph}<br/>[kasi]{.glyphsubtitle}   | plant, flower, tree, vegetation               | A plant with two pointed leaves at its top.                                    |
|  [kiwen]{.glyph}<br/>[kiwen]{.glyphsubtitle}  | rock, hard, tough, sturdy, durable            | A five-sided diamond shape                                                     |
|     [ko]{.glyph}<br/>[ko]{.glyphsubtitle}     | dust, goop, clay, paste, squishy thing        | A pile of goop, or a fluffy ball. Give it several curves!                      |
|   [telo]{.glyph}<br/>[telo]{.glyphsubtitle}   | liquid, water, fluid                          | Two wavy lines drawn horizontally, like waves on the beach                     |
| [kulupu]{.glyph}<br/>[kulupu]{.glyphsubtitle} | group, collection, nation, community          | Three circles in a triangle shape, with some space.                            |
|   [jaki]{.glyph}<br/>[jaki]{.glyphsubtitle}   | gross, garbage, trash, sick                   | Scribble!                                                                      |
|   [wawa]{.glyph}<br/>[wawa]{.glyphsubtitle}   | power, strength, courage, energy, electricity | A person holding their arms over their head                                    |
|   [suwi]{.glyph}<br/>[suwi]{.glyphsubtitle}   | sweet, soft, fluffy, cute, fragrant           | A cute and pleasant cat face like this emoticon: `^.^`                         |
|   [nasa]{.glyph}<br/>[nasa]{.glyphsubtitle}   | strange, weird, silly, rare                   | A spiral. Any spiral will do!                                                  |
|   [seli]{.glyph}<br/>[seli]{.glyphsubtitle}   | hot, fire, warm, hot object                   | A dot with three almost-vertical lines ("emitters") over top, like a big fire! |
|   [lete]{.glyph}<br/>[lete]{.glyphsubtitle}   | cold, ice, raw, undercooked, cold object      | Three crossing lines making a simple snowflake                                 |

### Intro to "li"

The next type of Toki Pona sentence is a simple but powerful addition!

> [subject] [li]{.tokipona} [predicate]

With this sentence, you can talk about things other than yourself and your
listener. While [li]{.tokipona} is present, any word but [mi]{.tokipona} and
[sina]{.tokipona} can be in the subject, and any word can be in the predicate
like in last lesson. You'll find that the variety in Toki Pona words lets you
say a lot, even with so few words!

<details> <summary> A note on "any word" </summary>

I do say "any word", but clever observers will have noticed I am treating the
word [li]{.tokipona} differently. It is introduced as a particle, its definition
is given in parentheses, and it is treated as a grammatical structure instead of
as a word. This is because [li]{.tokipona} cannot be used in the subject or
predicate, with some subtle exceptions we'll get to later. For now, everything
_else_ can be in the subject or predicate.

</details>

Since using [li]{.tokipona} lets you put any word in the subject, most of the
words in the lesson before can now be used there! This leans heavily into the
action/description duality described before. Unlike that duality, you can tell
which sense a word is meant in based on its place in a sentence. Words in the
subject are more likely to be specific objects or ideas, where words in the
predicate are more likely to be actions or descriptions!

::: warning

Remember, if the subject is _just_ [mi]{.tokipona} or _just_ [sina]{.tokipona},
do not include [li]{.tokipona}!

:::

Here's a guided example:

<details> <summary> [mama li musi]{.tokipona} </summary>

- Mom is hilarious.
- Dad is being funny.
- My parent is exciting!
- My babysitter is amusing!
- Grandpa joked!

</details>

Here, the subject is [mama]{.tokipona}, a parent or ancestor. Since the subject
isn't [mi]{.tokipona} or [sina]{.tokipona}, [li]{.tokipona} is present and
starts the predicate. Then the predicate is [musi]{.tokipona}, fun and
entertainment. [musi]{.tokipona} could be either a description or action here,
and these cannot be told apart without more context- Toki Pona doesn't tell them
apart! Check under the spoiler for possible interpretations.

### li and "and"

To say a subject does more than one thing, you say [li]{.tokipona} a second time
at the end of the predicate, marking another predicate. Saying [li]{.tokipona}
multiple times is like saying "and" in English, but just for the predicate!
Here's an example:

<details> <summary> [kulupu li suli li pona]{.tokipona} </summary>

- The community is huge, and wonderful!
- The collection is enormous, and pretty!
- The stack is tall, and fantastic!

</details>

Here, the subject [kulupu]{.tokipona} is doing two things: being
[suli]{.tokipona} (big) and being [pona]{.tokipona} (good).

Using more than one [li]{.tokipona} is the same as using two sentences with the
same subject. This means we can restate the one sentence above as these two
sentences, which have the same meaning together:

> [kulupu li suli. kulupu li pona.]{.tokipona}

Here's another example:

<details> <summary> [jan li tawa li lape]{.tokipona} </summary>

- The person walks, and goes to sleep.
- The person walks, and sleeps.
- Everyone is traveling, and sleeping.

</details>

Here, [jan]{.tokipona} is doing two different things: [tawa]{.tokipona}
(moving), and [lape]{.tokipona} (sleeping). Toki Pona words don't mark time, so
these two actions can happen at different times, but be described in one
sentence without issue!

And again, this is the same as the following two sentences:

> [jan li tawa. jan li lape. ]{.tokipona}

You can have as many predicates as you want, but try to keep your sentences
shorter- shorter sentences are easier to understand.

::: warning

[mi]{.tokipona} and [sina]{.tokipona} do not use [li]{.tokipona}, so you can't
_normally_ do this with them. Instead, use separate sentences: [mi tawa. mi lape.]{.tokipona}

:::

## Summary

### What did you learn?

1. You can use "li" to talk about anything

[li]{.tokipona} lets you talk about a variety of subjects in Toki Pona. Remember
that the word before is the subject, and the word after describes what the
subject _is_ or _does_- respectively called the subject and predicate! You can
think of [li]{.tokipona} being similar to English "doing" or "being," but
comparisons to other languages are no substitute for practice!

2. "mi" and "sina" work like "li"

In the previous lesson, we covered a sentence which exclusively began with
either [mi]{.tokipona} or [sina]{.tokipona}. In this lesson, we covered a
sentence where anything can start the sentence- so long as it is followed by
[li]{.tokipona}. These are actually the same kind of sentence!

> [[mi]{.tokipona}/[sina]{.tokipona}] [predicate]

> [subject] [li]{.tokipona} [predicate]

[mi]{.tokipona} and [sina]{.tokipona} are just special subjects. Another way to
think about this sentence is this: if the subject is _exactly_ [mi]{.tokipona}
or _exactly_ [sina]{.tokipona}, don't include [li]{.tokipona}. You can also
think of it as though [mi]{.tokipona} and [sina]{.tokipona} _are_
[li]{.tokipona} for their kind of sentence. These different ways of looking at
it are helpful tools, but don't let it get in the way of the language!

3. Most words are

Any _meaningful_ word may appear in either the subject, the predicate, or both
at once. When I say "meaningful", this refers the idea of a **content word**, or
a word which serves some _semantic_ function instead of an exclusively
grammatical one. The word [li]{.tokipona} is only grammatical- it is not a
content word. Every other word so far is a content word.

The word [li]{.tokipona} is a **particle**, and is not the only one! We will
learn about the rest in future lessons. What they have in common is having no
semantic function- no meaning.

There are also a handful of words which are so-called **pseudo-particles**. This
category is more blurry, but it contains words which have functions as particles
_and_ as content words. Again, we'll learn about those in a future lesson!
