There is a _lot_ of discourse about phatic phrases in Toki Pona. A phatic
phrase is a short and polite turn of phrase which usually doesn't convey deep
meaning. Phatic phrases exist in Toki Pona. However,
myself and others discourage their use, for good reason. Do you want to have
the following conversation?

> toki. sina seme?
>
> > mi pona. sina seme?
> >
> > > mi pona kin. [pini]

Not really. This doesn't convey anything about either speaker, and it doesn't
give you anything to think about.

If a friend asks you how your day went, do you say "fine" and leave it there? It isn't _wrong_ to do so.

If somebody teaches you a new skill, do you tell them only "thanks" and end
it there? Again, this is an acceptable way to express yourself, but wouldn't your teacher appreciate you expressing all of their impact on you?

Toki Pona places an emphasis on simplicity and breaking down your thoughts into
their important units. However, this does _not_ encourage over-simplifying to
the detriment of your conversations!

If you're in a conversation, think deeply about what you do, especially that your listener cares about. Answer earnestly
about how you feel, and what you appreciate in your friends, family, teachers,
and others. You should answer honestly to the questions "sina seme?" or "seme
li lon?"

> toki. sina seme?
>
> > mi pona! tenpo pini la mi pali e lipu sona pi toki ilo
> >
> > > wawa a! lipu la seme li lon?
> > >
> > > > lipu li pana e sona ni: ilo li ken... [awen]

Toki Pona is more than a language. It is a philosophy too.

There is knowledge all around you. If you are excited to learn, you should ask
for the knowledge!

And there is love all around you too. If you care about your relationships, show everyone that you care with your words.

## Phrases and context

What follows is a sort of anti-phrasebook, suggesting _continuations_ or
_replacements_ for specific phrases that would otherwise be phatic.
Importantly, I provide context in alternative situations for these, as
they change depending on what is currently happening!

Even then, this is far from everything that is possible. Keep your mind open and keep exploring!

### sina pona

"sina pona" is the common shorthand for "thank you", or "I appreciate you", all
in one. It literally means "you are good." On its own, it is an appreciated
gesture, but how can you answer more earnestly?

Each spoiler provides a literal interpretation, and sometimes a casual interpretation.

To someone who taught you a new skill:

<details><summary> sina pona tan pana sona. sona la mi ken... </summary>
You are good because of knowledge-giving. In the context of knowledge, I am able to ...

I appreciate your teaching! It has taught me to...

</details>

<details><summary> nasin sina li wawa a! mi sona la mi wawa. </summary>
Your method is powerful! If I understand, I am powerful.

The process you described is very effective! My understanding of it has helped me greatly.

</details>

To somebody who has given a gift:

<details><summary> ijo sin ni li pona tawa mi, li pona e mi! </summary>
This new thing is good to me, and helped me!

This gift is fantastic for me, and made me feel better!

</details>

### mi tawa

"mi tawa" is the common-use phrase for "goodbye," spoken by the person
leaving. Its literal interpretation is closer to "I am leaving", or "I am
moving" which contextually means leaving. What if the kind of leaving
you're doing isn't just about moving, such as quitting a video game? What if the importance isn't on how you leave, but where you're going?

You could express where you're going:

<details><summary> mi tawa ma sin </summary>
I go to a new place.

I am leaving for somewhere new!

</details>

<details><summary> mi tawa pali </summary>
I am going to work.
</details>

<details><summary> mi tawa tomo mi</summary>
I'm going to my home.
</details>

<details><summary> mi tawa tomo pi wawa sijelo </summary>
I am going to a body-power building.

I am going to the gym!

</details>

Or you what you're leaving to do:

<details><summary> mi tawa la mi moku </summary>
When I leave, I eat.

I'm leaving for dinner!

</details>

<details><summary> mi o pali </summary>
I must work.

I have to do my job.

</details>

Or talk about when you plan to come back:

<details><summary> mi weka lili, mi kama sin </summary>
I go away a little bit, and arrive again

I'm leaving for a short time, and I will come back!

</details>

<details><summary> mi tawa. tenpo kulupu kama la mi kama </summary>
I'm going. At an arriving group time, I'll arrive.

I'm leaving. I'm coming to the next meetup!

</details>

### tawa pona and well-wishes

"tawa pona" is the common-use phrase for "goodbye", spoken to the person who's
leaving generally. However, it is a well-wishing statement. Many variations exist, including those spoken by the one leaving.

Toki Pona: The Language of Good notes a few well-wishing phrases. They are similar to commands led by "o", but do not have the intent of instruction.

To somebody who is working:

<details><summary> pali pona! </summary>
Have a good time at work!
</details>

When you are leaving, and the others are staying:

<details><summary> awen pona! </summary>
While you're staying, have a good time!
</details>

When others are playing a game when you leave:

<details><summary> musi pona! </summary>
Have fun!
</details>

To somebody learning Toki Pona (or anything else):

<details><summary> kama sona pona! </summary>
Learn well!
</details>

### An expression in context

Imagine the following scenario:

You're watching your friend race around a track, going for first place.
You friend has been lagging just barely behind first or second throughout the race, but toward the end of the race, they get a second wind and manage to pick up their pace just enough to take the win.
After the race, you rush up to them and say "sina tawa pona a!"
In context, this phrase is just as much "You moved well!" as "You ran quickly!"
