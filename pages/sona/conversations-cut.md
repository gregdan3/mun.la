It goes a step further too- nouns don't mark their number or gender, and verbs don't mark their tense. You'll see what I mean when we get to translations.

For time reasons, I'm not going to define each of the words as I go- I'll give valid and helpful translations, and I'll spend more time on really important words, but I'm going to be focusing mainly on the grammar, the really big concepts you need to get started. It's up to you

As I translate, keep the "broad words" idea in mind! Hopefully, all the sentences I go over will be small enough that you can tell apart the words I do define from the ones I only provide in translations.

<!-- And don't worry if the translations themselves move a little quick- we're focused on the grammar. -->

## Resources

- First, here's another type of getting started lesson, but one of a different style: ilo Tani created the video "toki pona in 18 minutes," and it has the goal of covering absolutely everything you need, but very briefly. It's a great way to put all the ideas in your head right away.
- Next, here's several online lessons:
  - lipu sona pona, by jan Lentan, is an older but still very helpful course- I did some of my own learning from it.
  - o pilin e toki pona is a full-immersion course by jan Telakoman, and helpful even if you've completed other lessons!
  -

- And two online resources:
  - there is a dictionary called lipu Linku at linku.la,
  - and

<!-- # What did I gloss over? -->
<!---->
<!-- Something you might have noticed but I didn't draw attention to, was that toki pona words are very broad. All the words are plural or singular or whatever else- they don't mark number. All words can refer to the present, the past, the future, whenever you want- they don't mark time either. This means something like "mi" can refer to just yourself, or you and a friend, or a whole team that includes you. And it means that -->

<!-- For those who know their grammar terms, there are no conjugations or declensions- no inflection whatsoever. If you learn a word, you can use that word. -->
