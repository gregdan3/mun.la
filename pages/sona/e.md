## Overview

#### Objects and e

This new sentence is capable of changing things in the world. The subject can now act on other things, applying the predicate to something else, with the use of [e]{.tokipona}!

> [[mi]{.tokipona}/[sina]{.tokipona}] [predicate] [e]{.tokipona} [object]

> [subject] [li]{.tokipona} [predicate] [e]{.tokipona} [object]

This new phrase introduces a thing the subject acts on in a way that the predicate specifies.

<details><summary>A note about "predicate"</summary>

I am using "predicate" to refer to _just_ the position of the action/description of a phrase, excluding the object.

In common grammatical terms, "predicate" refers to the entirety of the action/description and the object(s) it acts on. However, it can also refer to just the action/description clause, which is very convenient for these lessons!

</details>

#### Changing things

Here are a few guided examples of how the subject acts on the object, applying the predicate to it:

<details> <summary> [mi pona e jan]{.tokipona} </summary>

- I help somebody.
- I improve people.
- I heal people.
- I tend to people.
- I make people feel better.

</details>

The [jan]{.tokipona} becomes [pona]{.tokipona} in some way, as in the translations given.

<details> <summary> [lape li wawa e sina]{.tokipona} </summary>

- Sleep makes you stronger
- Rest makes you confident
- Napping makes you energetic
- Relaxing energizes you
- Vacation empowers you

</details>

Here, [sina]{.tokipona} becomes [wawa]{.tokipona} in some way.

#### Not changing things

Not everything changes the object! Here are some examples, using two new words:

<details> <summary> [jan li pilin e kiwen]{.tokipona} </summary>

- The person feels a rock.
- Somebody touched metal.
- Everyone touched this stone.
- People have been feeling this rock.

</details>

Here, the [kiwen]{.tokipona} is _felt_ or _touched_, but it never is or becomes [pilin]{.tokipona}.
Instead, the subject is the only one that does any [pilin]{.tokipona}.

<details> <summary> [mi wile e telo]{.tokipona} </summary>

- I want water
- I need water
- I need (liquid) fuel
- I am thirsty

</details>

Again, the [telo]{.tokipona} is _wanted_ or _needed_, but it does not become [wile]{.tokipona} or do the action [wile]{.tokipona} or become describable by [wile]{.tokipona}. The subject _wants_, _needs_, [wile]{.tokipona} the [telo]{.tokipona}.

As you study, you'll get an intuitive sense for this difference.
Some words will be actions the subject takes on an object, but which do not change that object. [pana]{.tokipona} works this way!
Other words will change the object, applying a new property to the object.

<details> <summary> A note on "not" changing things </summary>

As you become more advanced in Toki Pona, you'll learn that the above is complicated! It _is_ possible to describe an object as a wanted object, and to apply want to that object. For the time being, this simplification will work.

That said, the following is possible:

> [mi wile e telo]{.tokipona}

"I want water."

> [telo wile li pona e mi]{.tokipona}

"The water I want will make me feel better."

This uses a modifier (next lesson!) to demonstrate the point, now referencing a "wanted liquid."

</details>

#### Multiple e

::: info

[Check out this video lesson too!](https://youtu.be/BGsodPu9UAw) There are a few other topics here, but the very start has what you need!

:::

Like [li]{.tokipona}, [e]{.tokipona} can be used more than once to apply a predicate to more than one object at a time! The predicate before applies to every object that follows. Like [li]{.tokipona}, this is like "and" in English, but now for the object!

<details> <summary> [kasi li pilin e suno e telo]{.tokipona} </summary>

The plant is feeling the sun and the water!

</details>

Here, the subject [kasi]{.tokipona} (plant) is [pilin]{.tokipona} (feeling) both [suno]{.tokipona} and [telo]{.tokipona}, (light and water).

Here's another example:

<details> <summary> [mi moku e suwi e lete]{.tokipona} </summary>

I eat sweets and ice cubes!

I eat sugar and ice.

</details>

Here, the subject [mi]{.tokipona} (I) is eating [suwi]{.tokipona} (something sweet) and [lete]{.tokipona}, something cold.

#### Multiple li and multiple e

When using multiple [li]{.tokipona} _and_ multiple [e]{.tokipona}, objects connect to the predicate right before. We saw this with using two [e]{.tokipona}, but it also applies if you use [li]{.tokipona} twice then [e]{.tokipona}- the first [li]{.tokipona} has no object, only the second one does.

<details> <summary> [kasi li suwi li pana e ko]{.tokipona} </summary>

The plant is sweet, and gives off dust!

The plant is cute, and is spitting sap!

</details>

Here, the [kasi]{.tokipona} is [suwi]{.tokipona}, and at the same time, it [pana]{.tokipona} (gives) some [ko]{.tokipona} (dust, slime)

<details> <summary> [kasi li pana e ko li suwi]{.tokipona} </summary>

The plant gives off dust, and is sweet!

</details>

This sentence means the same thing, but has the connected predicate and object, [pana]{.tokipona} and [ko]{.tokipona} swapped with the single predicate [pana]{.tokipona}. The meaning is still the same!

Objects _always_ connect to the predicate before.
For multiple [e]{.tokipona} with multiple [li]{.tokipona}, the rules are the same as with just multiple [e]{.tokipona}!

<details> <summary> [jan li jaki e lipu li telo e lipu]{.tokipona} </summary>

The person made a mess on the book and cleaned the book.

</details>

Here, [jan]{.tokipona} (a person) does two actions, acting on to two objects with each: First, they [jaki]{.tokipona} (make gross) a [lipu]{.tokipona} (document, book), then they [telo]{.tokipona} (water, clean) a [lipu]{.tokipona}. Often, the same word referenced twice is referring to the same object- so [lipu]{.tokipona} could be the same both times! But it can be a different object too. Watch for context!

::: warning

The last part of this section is a bit more advanced- it requires you to be thoughtful and intentional about how you speak. If you wanna get right to practice, [check out the exercises](#exercises)!

:::

There is some room for experimentation! The sentence from before can be made shorter but understood the same with relaxed grammar:

<details><summary>[jan li jaki li telo e lipu]{.tokipona}</summary>

**If [jaki]{.tokipona} and [telo]{.tokipona} both apply to the [lipu]{.tokipona}**:

Somebody made a mess on this book, and cleaned it.

**If they are separate statements in the same sentence**:

Somebody is gross, and cleaned this book.

</details>

Normally, the first predicate [jaki]{.tokipona} would not connect to the object [lipu]{.tokipona}. But some speakers will apply two or more predicates to the same object, like this sentence- it's relaxed!

Here, [jan]{.tokipona} (a person) does two actions, acting on to one object with each: First, they [jaki]{.tokipona} (make gross) a [lipu]{.tokipona} (document, book), then they [telo]{.tokipona} (water, clean) a [lipu]{.tokipona}. Often, the same word in the same position a second time means the same object- so the [lipu]{.tokipona} could be the same both times! But it can be a different object too. Watch for context!

If you haven't checked under the spoiler already, check now. There are multiple meanings possible if you use this relaxed grammar!

::: info

When somebody doesn't understand you, try restating yourself. Using more words to be more specific is always helpful!

## Takeaway

#### Grammar

Toki Pona sentences now look like this:

> [subject] ([li]{.tokipona}) [predicate] ([e]{.tokipona} [object])

Parentheses indicate something which is optional or conditional, and brackets are stand-ins for words as before.

Breaking it down, we can talk about what the speaker and listener do, or what describes the speaker/listener:

> [[mi]{.tokipona}/[sina]{.tokipona}] [predicate]

We can talk about what other things do or are like:

> [subject] [li]{.tokipona} [predicate]

We can now talk about what the speaker and listener do to _other things_.

> [[mi]{.tokipona}/[sina]{.tokipona}] [predicate] [e]{.tokipona} [object]

And the same goes for what third person things do to other third person things, including themselves!

> [subject] [li]{.tokipona} [predicate] [e]{.tokipona} [object]

#### Content Words and Particles

The list of particles we know has grown to include [e]{.tokipona}! Every other new word is a content word.
