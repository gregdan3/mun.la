## Overview

#### Objects and e

This new sentence is capable of changing things in the world. The subject can now act on other things, applying the predicate to something else, with the use of [e]{.tokipona}!

> [[mi]{.tokipona}/[sina]{.tokipona}] [predicate] [e]{.tokipona} [object]

> [subject] [li]{.tokipona} [predicate] [e]{.tokipona} [object]

This new phrase introduces a thing the subject acts on in a way that the predicate specifies.

<details><summary>A note about "predicate"</summary>

I am using "predicate" to refer to _just_ the position of the action/description of a phrase, excluding the object.

In common grammatical terms, "predicate" refers to the entirety of the action/description and the object(s) it acts on. However, it can also refer to just the action/description clause, which is very convenient for these lessons!

</details>

#### Changing things

Here are a few guided examples of how the subject acts on the object, applying the predicate to it:

<details> <summary> [mi pona e jan]{.tokipona} </summary>

- I help somebody.
- I improve people.
- I heal people.
- I tend to people.
- I make people feel better.

</details>

The [jan]{.tokipona} becomes [pona]{.tokipona} in some way, as in the translations given.

<details> <summary> [lape li wawa e sina]{.tokipona} </summary>

- Sleep makes you stronger
- Rest makes you confident
- Napping makes you energetic
- Relaxing energizes you
- Vacation empowers you

</details>

Here, [sina]{.tokipona} becomes [wawa]{.tokipona} in some way.

#### Not changing things

Not everything changes the object! Here are some examples, using two new words:

<details> <summary> [jan li pilin e kiwen]{.tokipona} </summary>

- The person feels a rock.
- Somebody touched metal.
- Everyone touched this stone.
- People have been feeling this rock.

</details>

Here, the [kiwen]{.tokipona} is _felt_ or _touched_, but it never is or becomes [pilin]{.tokipona}.
Instead, the subject is the only one that does any [pilin]{.tokipona}.

<details> <summary> [mi wile e telo]{.tokipona} </summary>

- I want water
- I need water
- I need (liquid) fuel
- I am thirsty

</details>

Again, the [telo]{.tokipona} is _wanted_ or _needed_, but it does not become [wile]{.tokipona} or do the action [wile]{.tokipona} or become describable by [wile]{.tokipona}. The subject _wants_, _needs_, [wile]{.tokipona} the [telo]{.tokipona}.

As you study, you'll get an intuitive sense for this difference.
Some words will be actions the subject takes on an object, but which do not change that object. [pana]{.tokipona} works this way!
Other words will change the object, applying a new property to the object.

<details> <summary> A note on "not" changing things </summary>

As you become more advanced in Toki Pona, you'll learn that the above is complicated! It _is_ possible to describe an object as a wanted object, and to apply want to that object. For the time being, this simplification will work.

That said, the following is possible:

> [mi wile e telo]{.tokipona}

"I want water."

> [telo wile li pona e mi]{.tokipona}

"The water I want will make me feel better."

This uses a modifier (next lesson!) to demonstrate the point, now referencing a "wanted liquid."

</details>

#### Multiple e

Like [li]{.tokipona}, [e]{.tokipona} can be used more than once to apply a predicate to more than one object at a time! This applies to every object that follows a predicate. Like [li]{.tokipona}, this is like "and" in English!

<details> <summary> [mi moku e suwi e lete]{.tokipona} </summary>

I eat sugar and ice.

</details>

<details> <summary> [kasi li pilin e seli e telo]{.tokipona} </summary>

The plant is touching the fire and the water!

</details>

#### Multiple li and multiple e

When using multiple [li]{.tokipona} _and_ multiple [e]{.tokipona}, objects connect to the predicate right before.
If you use [li]{.tokipona} twice and [e]{.tokipona} after both, only the second predicate [li]{.tokipona} matters to the object [e]{.tokipona}!

<details> <summary> [kasi li suwi li pana e ko]{.tokipona} </summary>

The plant is sweet, and gives off dust!

</details>

<details> <summary> [kasi li pana e ko li suwi]{.tokipona} </summary>

The plant gives off dust, and is sweet!

</details>

Objects _always_ connect to the predicate before.
For multiple [e]{.tokipona} with multiple [li]{.tokipona}, the rules are the same as with just multiple [e]{.tokipona}!

<details> <summary> [jan li jaki e lipu li telo e lipu]{.tokipona} </summary>

The person made a mess on the book and cleaned the book.

</details>

<details><summary> A note about multiple [li]{.tokipona} and multiple [e]{.tokipona} </summary>

There is some room for experimentation! The above statement can be understood similarly with a relaxed grammar:

> [jan li jaki li telo e lipu]{.tokipona}

The first predicate does not connect to the object because another predicate interrupts it.
Despite that, this sentence can be understood the same as the above one.

That is, can be. It could be understood as "This person is gross, and washes the book."

If somebody doesn't understand you, try restating yourself. Using more words to be more specific is always helpful!

</details>

Halloween night! A group of sheet-clad friends, dressed like classic ghosts, walk from home to home shouting "Trick or treat!" and get piles of sweets in hand at each door! At the end of the night, everyone compares their hauls. One friend pulls a weighty, dirty chunk from his bag and says...

## Takeaway

#### Grammar

Toki Pona sentences now look like this:

> [subject] ([li]{.tokipona}) [predicate] ([e]{.tokipona} [object])

Parentheses indicate something which is optional or conditional, and brackets are stand-ins for words as before.

Breaking it down, we can talk about what the speaker and listener do, or what describes the speaker/listener:

> [[mi]{.tokipona}/[sina]{.tokipona}] [predicate]

We can talk about what other things do or are like:

> [subject] [li]{.tokipona} [predicate]

We can now talk about what the speaker and listener do to _other things_.

> [[mi]{.tokipona}/[sina]{.tokipona}] [predicate] [e]{.tokipona} [object]

And the same goes for what third person things do to other third person things, including themselves!

> [subject] [li]{.tokipona} [predicate] [e]{.tokipona} [object]

#### Content Words and Particles

The list of particles we know has grown to include [e]{.tokipona}! Every other new word is a content word.
