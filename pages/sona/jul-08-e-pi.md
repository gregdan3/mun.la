toki a, jan ale o! mi jan Kekan San! mi wile pana e sona pi toki pona!

Hey everyone, I'm gregdan3, and today I wanna teach you about Toki Pona.

Today, we're gonna be going over the function of **e** and **pi**, with a few bonuses thrown in about asking questions. This lesson assumes you caught my lesson last month about how **li** and **modifiers** work!

Also, remember that we're doing the vocab as we go, instead of all up front. We're focusing on the grammar and the feel of Toki Pona- and you can memorize the words on your own!

Let's get right into it with an example, starting with, what is **e**, and what is **pi**?

---

We Know that we can talk about what the subject is doing or being with the word **li**.

The word **e** gives us a new tool: we can talk about what the subject _does to_ somebody or something else! Here's a basic example of what that looks like:

> [suno li seli e mi]{.tokipona}

This means "the sun heats me." Interpreted very literally, you might say "the sun applies warmth to me."

With **e**, the subject _changes_ the object. So the sun is changing "mi", and that change is "seli". So I could then say:

> [mi seli]{.tokipona}

---

But not every word is so clear as seli when used with **e**. Take for example, **pona**:

> [mi pona e tomo]{.tokipona}

We know the definition of pona to be good, positive, simple, or pleasant.

Here, we might interpret it as meaning heal, help, repair, or improve.

Since pona is in a new part of the sentence, we _interpret_ a little differently to match.

But the meaning of pona is still the same. All that's changed is the usage, and thus how we might translate it into English.

Case in point, you could also translate this as "I apply good to the building."

Now that we understand the basics of **e**, let's look at some more examples.

---

Just like with the subject before **li** and the verb after, we can put just about any word we want after **e**:

> [kulupu li wile e pali mi]{.tokipona}

The words after **e** can be people, places, things, actions, ideas, literally anything.

But this sentence is a little odd based on what we've learned- we're not saying that the "pali mi", "my work" becomes able to want, right? It "becomes wanted," maybe?

That's about interpretation! There are a few words that work with e, but don't necessarily change the object when they do it.

To be clear, you could still say:

> [pali mi li wile]{.tokipona}

And that would be correct- but some speakers discourage or avoid this, because it can be a little confusing. I would say experiment and figure out what works for you!

Here's another example though:

> [sina lukin e kili tu]{.tokipona}

Again, this is a special case. This probably doesn't mean "the two fruits become able to see." It could mean "the two fruits become seen."

But mostly, this is another case where the object is unchanged by an action.

You are looking, viewing, observing, but the kili tu are the same.

So what we've learned is that **e** sometimes just describes an action that involves, but doesn't change, the object. Sure!

As you practice, you'll get a feel for this difference, but

> [lukin wile sona pilin]{.tokipona}

do this often.

---

Next, there's the word **pi**.

> [mun li pana e sona pi toki pona]{.tokipona}

**pi** lets you make fancier modifiers, to any part of speech.

Remember how with normal modifiers, all the words after the first modify the first?

**pi** changes that, but only a bit. The first word after pi is a new head, and the words after that modify that first word.

Then, the whole thing goes on to modify the head of the current phrase.

[direction: draw arrows from pona to toki, then pi toki pona to sona]

Altogether, our interpretation is something like "a star gives Toki Pona knowledge." Hey, that sounds familiar!

But this is new to us, so let's try another example:

> [akesi pi selo kiwen li moku]

Here, the word **akesi**, reptile or amphibian, is the head of the subject.

Then pi comes, and turns **selo**, skin, wall, boundary, into another head.

**kiwen** modifies that like normal- so we have **selo kiwen**, tough skin.

And putting it all together, we have akesi pi selo kiwen- a tough-skinned lizard!

Everything after pi is one big, fancy modifier for the head of the phrase. Otherwise, it works just like normal modifiers!

---

Quick note: Using one pi is almost always enough. Using two pi comes up rarely.

Any more than that, and you might want to take a step back and rethink your sentence. In fact, do that for just two pi.

The same applies to complex phrases without pi- if you have one phrase with more than four words, or lots of extra use of li or e, you might be cramming your sentence!

Toki Pona focuses on simplicity for a reason. Lean into it! Practice having shorter, more focused sentences.

We're gonna try that with the idea from the previous sentence- but not breaking it up in the way you think!

> [akesi ni li jo e selo kiwen]{.tokipona}

> [ona li moku]{.tokipona}

Now, you might complain that the new sentence is longer.

But it gives us more information, and more clarity, at the same time.

The first sentence gets rid of pi, instead describing the akesi with a sentence in full, rather than cram that info into modifiers.

Then the second sentence is basically the same as before, but the subject can be just "ona" because we just talked about the akesi.

The grammar is there to help you. It helps you organize your thoughts. pi is helpful, but sometimes it obscures the benefits of the rest of the grammar.

---

By the way, if you remember our bonus from last time about asking questions with **seme**, you can do that with pi too:

> [sina pali pi wawa seme?]{.tokipona}

This is something like "You're working with what strength?" Or interpreting a little more, maybe "How hard are you working?"

**seme** can go wherever you need it to!

---

I'd like to end this lesson with another bonus: we're gonna ask questions, but this time with verb doubling.

If you've looked over the word list for Toki Pona, you might have noticed that there aren't any words for yes or no.

What we do instead is double the first word of the verb, then put **ala** between them.

> [supa li lete ala lete?]{.tokipona}

This is the closest thing to a yes-or-no question in Toki Pona.

Interpreting this literally, you might say "is the floor cold or not cold?"

And to answer, you repeat the verb for yes: **lete**

Or you'd say **ala** for no.

Let's try another:

> [kala li kute ala kute e mi?]{.tokipona}

This question doesn't ask about a specific part of the sentence.

This could be "Did a _fish_ hear me?" or "_Did_ the fish hear me?" or "Did the fish hear _me_?"

You'll have to rely on context to know exactly what's being asked about!

---

One last bit, a little related to the questions!

Something fun about Toki Pona is that you'll hear speakers repeat what eachother say. For example:

> [kasi ni li suli a]{.tokipona}

> [suli wawa a!]{.tokipona}

This is a lot like how answering "yes" to questions works- the second statement is not just an acknowledgement, but an agreement! Experiment with this!

---

That's all for today's lesson! Thank you all so much for listening, and for learning.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask me here, or on Discord!

I'm gonna get this recording up on YouTube, so be sure to check it out when it goes up!
