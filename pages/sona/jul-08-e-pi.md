We know the definition of pona to be good, positive, simple, pleasant. Here, as a verb, we might interpret it as heal, help, improve. But that doesn't mean the definition of pona changed! The same underlying definition of good still applies- we're just adapting our english interpretation to match its actual function. You can imagine mi pona e tomo even more literally as "I apply good to the building."
