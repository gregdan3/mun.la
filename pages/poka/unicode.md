so, we'd like to propose 3 amendments then:

- that in determining a representative glyph, if a sufficient number of examples of a proposed representative glyph cannot be found among handwriting samples, it prevents the encoding the character. (this is offered in lieu of the possibility that the character is encoded with no given representative glyph.)
  - a number of examples is "sufficient" if it is an appreciable portion of the
    number of samples seen for the least-used pu words, monsi, selo, lupa, and
    nena.
- that backwards compatibility with UCSUR is not considered for encoding a character.
  - among written UCSUR (which there is not a lot of), there are very few documents which somebody would go back to re-set in Unicode once that standard became available (e.g. nobody is gonna go through to edit their discord messages, and nobody would go back to read those edited messages either). of those documents that somebody might re-set, there are likely near to zero instances those words which would otherwise not be considered for encoding on the basis of "teachworthiness or importance" as outlined in step 1 of the proposal. for reference, the characters for pake, powe, apeja, and kokosila do not appear in any of the UCSUR-set stories on utala.pona.la. (i checked this just a few minutes ago.)
- (tentative) that USCUR cannot encode any character which does not pass the handwriting sample test
