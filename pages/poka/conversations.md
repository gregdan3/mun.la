toki a, jan ale o! mi jan Kekan San! mi wile pana e sona pi toki pona!

Hey everyone, I'm gregdan3, and today I wanna teach you about Toki Pona!

# Goals and Topics

The goal of this presentation is to take you from zero to basic conversation in Toki Pona. I'm not going to cover everything- I can't- but I'll cover enough to get you started, and shoutout some resources at the end to help you keep going!

We are going to briefly discuss all of the following:

- How words work
- sitelen pona
- pronouns
- basic sentences
- modifiers
- questions
- objects
- a bit of interjections

This leaves a _lot_ on the cutting room floor, including commands and instructions, context, prepositions, preverbs, semantic spaces, names, numbers, the list of words and their meanings, and certainly more. Not to mention, I'm only going over each of these topics briefly.

But don't worry: As important as they are, you won't need prepositions to get started. In most language learning, we'd start with asking where the bathroom is. But conveniently, we can skip this, because most Toki Pona is spoken on the internet. The question would be totally useless!

Let's get started.

<!-- at the end of this talk, you _will_ be able to ask where the bathroom is. And this will be completely useless, because most Toki Pona is spoken on the internet! Let's get started. -->

# How Words Work

In Toki Pona, words are broad. Like, really broad. Imagine the English word fruit for example: it doesn't mean "apple" or "banana" or "durian", but it can refer to any of these.

Toki Pona words all work like this: they "mean" some broad concept, but can refer to lots of specific things that fit into that concept.

It goes a step further too- nouns don't mark their number, and verbs don't mark their tense. You'll see what I mean when we get to translations.

Let's look at the name of the language to demonstrate how this works in Toki Pona:

toki refers to speech, conversation, thought, and language. It's not any one of these- it's all of them, as one big idea-blob: communication, in all its forms.

pona refers to good things like friendliness, positivity, being helpful, and fixing things. Again, not any one of these, but all of them at once: positive things and traits of all kinds.

But together, "toki pona" can mean "friendly conversation", "positive thought", and of course "good language".

For time reasons, I'm not going to be defining each of the words as I go- I'll give valid and helpful translations, and I'll spend more time on really important words, but I'm going to be focusing mainly on the grammar, the really big concepts you need to get started. As I translate, keep the "broad words" idea in mind!

<!-- And don't worry if the translations themselves move a little quick- we're focused on the grammar. -->

But before we get to sentences, or grammar, or translations, we need to talk about these symbols!

# sitelen pona

This here, that you've already seen, is the "logo" of sorts for Toki Pona. The circle with three lines over it is the word "toki", and the smile-like line on the inside is the word "pona". In normal writings, you'll usually them side by side rather than one inside the other, but it means the same either way.

This way of writing is called "sitelen pona", literally "good writing", and it is toki pona's most adorable writing system.

sitelen pona is logographic, so each word has a symbol. Every symbol means exactly one word, and nearly all the words have exactly one symbol- assuming they do have exactly one works for now. Lastly, each symbol is representative of the idea of the word! Uh, except for grammar words, then the symbol kinda looks like punctuation to my English-reading eyes.

Anyway, For this talk, all sitelen pona will be annotated with their pronunciation, but I encourage you to study the sitelen pona alongside the language itself!

Alright, _now_ we can actually start on the language.

# mi and sina and ona

mi, sina, and ona are toki pona's pronouns, and you'll be using them a lot! In fact, you'll use mi and sina so much, that they're a little different from other subjects.

<!-- For their symbols, if you imagine looking at a hand from the top down, mi is like pointing toward yourself with your left thumb, sina is like pointing forward with your right index finger, and ona is like pointing to the left with your right index finger. -->

<!-- Backtracking to the symbols, "pona" is like a smile, "suwi" is like the emoticon ^.^, and "sona" is like a piece of paper, but these three lines overhead indicate it's giving off something. -->

Let's look at some sentences. These first few will have just a subject and a verb:

> mi pona, "I am well" or "We are good". mi is a first person pronoun: I, we, me.

> sina suwi, "You are cute", or "Y'all are adorable". sina is a second person pronoun: you, y'all.

> ona li sona, "They understand", or "They know". ona is a third person pronoun: they, it, he, she.

In the first two sentences, mi and sina are the subject and are immediately followed by a verb- the action of the sentence. This is always the case: if mi and sina are the exact subject, the verb always comes next.

But in the third, ona is followed by the word "li". For ona, and all other subjects _besides_ mi and sina, li goes afterward and marks the start of the verb.

mi and sina are special because doing it this way is a little more natural, and a little more comfortable to say.

Otherwise, these three are all the same kind of sentence: a subject, then a verb. Let's look at a few more:

> mi lape, "I rested", "I slept", "I will relax"

> sina kute, "You listened", "y'all will listen"

> ona li suli, "It was tall", "She will be important"

This is a good moment to remind you of the whole "nouns don't mark number, verbs don't mark tense" thing.

In the previous set of translations, we noted that "mi pona" can mean "I am well", or "we are good". "mi" could have been just the speaker, or a group including the speaker.

In these translations, we noted that "sina kute" can mean "You listened", or "y'all will listen". "kute", listening, could have happened at any time- not just the present.

In fact, we can go another step further- Toki Pona's verb doesn't tell apart "doing" from "being." This means the verb can be an action, or a description, and grammatically these two are identical.

So you might be wondering, how are you supposed to tell apart all these different cases if the sentence doesn't tell you?

The answer is context. If you're speaking directly to a friend and nobody else, and they say "mi", they probably mean just themselves.

If you're in a big group walking down the street but need to split up, you might hear somebody else say "sina" and figure they mean the half of the group that they aren't in.

And if context isn't enough, you can always add more information by adding more words to the sentence.

<!-- note to  future me: this is a topic unto itself and is a little awkward to fit in here -->

<!-- Okay, what's important about these isn't the grammar- we got that. What's important is those translations! -->
<!---->
<!-- In the previous set of translations, we noted that "mi pona" can mean "I am well", or "we are good". -->
<!---->
<!-- Toki Pona words don't mark number, so these words can refer to one, two, a dozen, an army, or any other number of things. "I" and "we" are a part of the word "mi". -->
<!---->
<!-- In these translations, we noted that "sina kute" can mean "You listened", or "y'all will listen." -->
<!---->
<!-- Toki Pona words also don't mark tense, so these verbs can be right now, in the past, in the future, will have been in the past, and so on. -->
<!---->
<!-- Normally, this question is answered with the word "context". Every single teacher in the community will tell you "context". -->
<!---->
<!-- And that's true. But I think it's a little more than context. It's also patterns, and intuition. -->
<!---->
<!-- It's not that "mi" can be any size of group including the speaker and you have to figure out how big that group is- -->
<!---->
<!-- It's that "mi" can be any size of group including the speaker- but it's probably just themselves. -->
<!---->
<!-- This idea that the sentence doesn't tell you when something happens or how many people were there isn't so scary when you realize that, most of the time, you have a pretty good idea before any words were even said. -->

---

We'll cover that shortly, but let's have a bonus pronoun before we continue:

We also have "ni", a demonstrative pronoun, which means this, that, these, or those. Here are a few sentences:

> ni li nasa, "That was strange", "Those are unusual"

> ni li wawa, "This is amazing", "That is forceful", "These are powerful"

li makes a return, marking the verb for us. You'll see "li" a _lot_. Fun fact: It's easier to tell part "mi pona" and "ni li pona" because of the grammatical difference, the use of the word li in one and not the other! And believe me, that difference is important.

Otherwise, "ni" works about how you'd expect! It can refer to objects near and far from you, ideas you're about to speak or just spoke, and tons more.

So now, we have a handle on the pronouns. We can talk about ourselves with mi, people we're speaking to with sina, other people and things with ona, and anything we can point at with ni.

# Modifiers

Next, we're gonna look at modifiers. You might know them better as adjectives- same thing, but for every part of speech.

As a matter of fact, we already saw one of these: the name of the language, "toki pona," has one modifier!

You'll note the translations I gave earlier were all types of communication, even if they were specifically "good" communication: positive thought, friendly conversation, good language.

This tells us something important about modifiers: Modifiers can't change what the thing is, only make it more specific. Wiiiith one exception in the word "ala", which we'll get to soon.

But otherwise, this means you could pretend the modifiers are not in the phrase, and still be able to understand the sentence. And this is a good way to practice!

<!-- The first word of a phrase is called the head, and is the most important part of knowing what is being talked about- just like the sentences we've already looked at.  -->

But modifiers can provide very helpful information in understanding what something is, or telling apart multiple similar things. Here's some example sentences:

> ni li akesi lili, "this is a small frog", "that was a tiny snake". We have "akesi", a reptile, and it's now lili- small. It's still "akesi", like "toki pona" is still "toki!"

> jan ni li kama, "this person has arrived", "those people are coming". We can use our pronouns to modify things, and modifying things with ni to point them out or refer back to them is super helpful!

> nasin kiwen jelo li suli, "The yellow brick road is long". You can have any number of modifiers on a word, and the order of those modifiers doesn't usually matter.

What we see in these sentences is that modifiers can apply to any part of speech- right now, we only have the subject and verb, but we'll have objects and prepositions shortly.

In fact, let's practice that any-part-of-speech idea by rewriting two of these sentences:

> akesi ni li lili, "this frog is small", "that snake was tiny." We're giving the same information as in "ni li akesi lili", but now "ni" is a modifier, and "lili" is the verb!

> nasin ni li kiwen jelo li suli. "This road is made of yellow brick, and long." That's right: we can have more than one li! And the other bit, which you may have noticed, is that the verb of the sentence can convey descriptive information.

Alright, that's enough on modifiers. Now, we need to get to questions- and once you have questions down, you'll have everything you need to have a conversation! Except, you know, all the words- buuuuut we don't have all day!

# Your first question

So, In Toki Pona, questions are expressed with the grammar, and they have three forms. Let's look at each:

> ona li lukin ala lukin?, "Is he looking?", or "Are they staring?".

This type of question takes the first word of the verb, here "lukin", doubles it, and puts "ala" between the two. You could translate this question more literally as "Is he looking or not looking?"

You'll recognize the word "ala" from the modifiers section before- it's that "one exception" I mentioned, where as a modifier it changes the word it modifies. We're almost to the explanation, but for now it's just helping us mark questions. Here's another sentence:

> ni li lipu ala lipu?, "Is this a piece of paper?" or "Is that a leaf?".

This, and the question before, are yes or no questions, but Toki Pona has no word for "yes" or "no". Instead, you repeat the verb for yes, so to that first question we could say "lukin.", meaning "Looking". Or, you can say "ala" or "lukin ala", "not looking." And for the second question, we would say "lipu" for yes, or "ala." or "lipu ala" for no.

There's that explanation for ala! When answering a question, you add it to negative answers to say "no". In general, ala can be used as a modifier to mean "not". "lipu ala" would mean "not a card", or "not a book". You can use ala as a modifier in normal sentences too, but we'll focus on asking and answering questions for now.

<!-- Here's one more of these questions before we move on: -->

---

Here's the next type of question, and it's even easier to follow:

> sina musi anu seme?, "Are you having fun?" "Are you funny?"

> mi ante anu seme?, "Am I different?" "Am I changed?"

This is also a yes-no question, and you answer the same way: to the first question, you can say "musi" for yes, and "ala" or "musi ala" for no. Same deal for the second question, "ante" for yes, "ante ala" or "ala" for no.

But the grammar is a little more open-ended here. The phrase "anu seme" is tacked onto the end of a statement, in order to indicate that the statement is a question- that phrase can be put onto the end of a sentence no matter how long it is.

There are actually a few "technically" things I could say about this type of question- you can technically put the phrase "anu seme" onto any part of speech, not just the end of the sentence. And, technically, this question format can indicate uncertainty without expecting an answer- we won't worry about either of those, for now, but you'll run into them as you explore the community.

Oh, but there is one more "technically" that is important: You can answer this type of question with "ni" for yes, or "ni ala" or "ala" for no. Interpreting it literally in English as "this" or "not this" makes it a little silly sounding, but it is very clear in practice.

The meaning in answering the question is essentially the same, but some speakers prefer this way of answering questions, especially anu seme questions, because it's a little easier to know what to respond with, and it more clearly confirms or denies the entire sentence.

Let's do one more of these questions before we continue:

> ilo mi li kalama anu seme? "Is my phone making sound?" "Is my drill noisy?"

The subject is "ilo mi", my tool, and the verb is "kalama," sound. "anu seme" indicates this is a question as we've discussed, so this is a question asking whether my tool is making sound or not.

---

Alright, one more type of question, and this is the most important one.

So, that word "seme" from before does more than just live in the phrase "anu seme". It also works on its own, and can replace essentially any word that isn't part of the grammar.

seme stands in for any missing information, so you can use it to ask any sort of who, what, where, when, why, or how type of question.

With the grammar we have so far, subject-verb sentences and modifiers, we can only really ask "who" or "what". But let's do that!

> "sina seme?", "what are you doing?"

Here, the subject is "sina" or "you", and "seme" is the verb- the entire verb. So this question is asking, what action are you taking? Or, what describes you? Let's try another:

> "seme li ni?", "What did this?" "Who did that?"

Here, the subject is seme- so we're asking for the actor, the something or somebody who did something. And that something is just "ni"- this, or that. That is to say, we're trying to figure out who or what did some thing we're looking at, pointing at, or referencing. ni can just be a verb- an action or maybe description that we can point at, or have recently talked about, or will talk about.

But what about answering these questions? Turns out, you already know how- you just fill in the blank. This can mean saying just the word or phrase that fits, or repeating the sentence with the word "seme" replaced with your answer.

For example, the question "sina seme" can be answered with "pali", "working", or "mi pali", "I am working." The first fills in the blank, and the second restates the sentence, but both provide the same information.

Let's do another one of these

<!-- Technically, it can be fit onto any part of speech because "anu" just means "or" for the current part of speech. But putting "anu seme" at the end of the sentence is so common, we can pretend that's all you do to get you started, and get into the details another time. -->
<!-- It can also, occasionally, indicate uncertainty that doesn't expect an answer. -->

# Interjections

Now, let's move on to interjections. They're pretty easy, so this will be brief.

You know all those questions we answered before? The answers are interjections- words or phrases, but not complete sentences. That much is obvious-

But there are more types of interjections. As a general statement, any non-grammar word can be an interjection, and what they mean as an interjections has to do with the meaning of the word.

For example, It's pretty clear how "ala" relates to "no."

But _every_ word does this- "toki" is used for "hello," kinda like starting a conversation by saying "conversation!"

"pona", good and pleasant, is used to acknowledge that something is good.

"sona", knowledge and knowing, is used to indicate you understand something.

"wawa", powerful and strong, is used to say something is impressive or amazing.

And the word "a" can be used for essentially any emotion or emphasis.

For this talk, all we're really concerned with is putting this idea in your head- interjections come up a _lot_ in conversation, so they're pretty important.

# Objects

# Summary

Here's a rapid-fire rundown of every topic, just to remind you of how much ground we covered:

- Words are super broad, like the english word fruit, but even bigger.
- The grammar is broad too- "doing" and "being" are the same thing, nouns don't tell you number, and verbs don't tell you when something happens.
- The basic pronouns are mi, "I, me, we", sina: "you, "y'all", and ona: "she, it, they, he." There's also "ni", "this, that, these, those."
- The word li is used to mark the start of the verb for any subject besides mi or sina. mi or sina are special and don't need it, but they still have to be the _exact_ subject for that to be the case.

# Resources

- First, here's another type of getting started lesson, but one of a different style: ilo Tani created the video "toki pona in 18 minutes," and it has the goal of covering absolutely everything you need, but very briefly. It's a great way to put all the ideas in your head right away.
- Next, here's several online lessons:

<!-- # What did I gloss over? -->
<!---->
<!-- Something you might have noticed but I didn't draw attention to, was that toki pona words are very broad. All the words are plural or singular or whatever else- they don't mark number. All words can refer to the present, the past, the future, whenever you want- they don't mark time either. This means something like "mi" can refer to just yourself, or you and a friend, or a whole team that includes you. And it means that -->
<!---->
<!-- For those who know their grammar terms, there are no conjugations or declensions- no inflection whatsoever. If you learn a word, you can use that word. -->
