Nobody knows how long it takes to learn Toki Pona. Nobody knows how long it takes to
become "fluent," "skilled," or
"conversational" either. Nobody even knows how long it takes to learn all the words.

The community has been interested in this question for a long time, but no one has come up with any answer better than anecdotes.
There _is_ a notion that Toki Pona is "easier" to learn than natural languages, and even that it is the "easiest" language to learn. Odds are, neither of these can be tested, so they'll never be more than beliefs that some members of the community hold[^me_too]. There is not and has never been any evidence-supported answer to how long it takes to learn Toki Pona[^telakoman].

[^me_too]:
    I'm one of them! I firmly believe that Toki Pona is the "easiest" language to
    learn. That doesn't mean it's easy, though. But, when I say
    "easiest language to learn," people seem to understand "can be learned with little effort" as
    opposed to "can be learned with less effort than other languages." Frustrating!

[^telakoman]: It would be really silly to write an article where I try to find a source for the 30 hour claim, then open the article by baiting with an even more ludicrous claim, right?

Well, until now.

## You can learn Toki Pona in 10 _study_-hours, _but_

- "learn" means "become conversational in." It **does not** mean fluent.
- Those 10 hours are spread over 30 days. Breaks matter!
- There's only one source of evidence- but granted, that is better than no evidence!
- That evidence is the only learning method that these numbers are known to apply to[^other_methods].

[^other_methods]:
    Stated more clearly: There could be other methods of learning Toki
    Pona that are equally as fast. They just don't have evidence yet! And, while we're
    here, there are absolutely learning methods that are slower.

In January 2023, jan Telakoman published [o pilin e toki pona](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwYL9_SRAk8EXSZPSTm9lm2kD_Z1RzUgm), "Experience Toki Pona". It's a Toki Pona course made entirely of [comprehensible input](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis). He then asked prospective learners to take his 30 day challenge, where they would watch one of these videos every day for 30 days. At the end of the challenge, they'd hop on a call with jan Telakoman, discuss the challenge, and have a conversation in Toki Pona to put the course to the test.

Assuming participants follow the rules of the challenge, they will spend about 10 hours (20 minutes per video x 30 videos) studying Toki Pona over the course of 30 days. That's an excellent benchmark, and a very realistic timeline to become _conversational_ in Toki Pona. So, has anyone done it?

Yes! [This playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwYL9_SRAk8F1hpZqv-pTgtnAjtD4yAy5), with 14 videos as of writing, documents those who took the 30 day challenge and then recorded a talk with jan Telakoman. All of these videos feature a purely Toki Pona conversation, and most of those conversations are over ten minutes long. These conversations do have their fair share of struggles, but each person does successfully hold a fairly long conversation with jan Telakoman. Or, put another way, they have achieved a conversational level of Toki Pona.

With this, we can confidently claim that it takes at least **10 hours** over **30 days** to become **conversational** in Toki Pona.

And this claim is much more apt- in addition to the evidence behind it, it portrays
the process of learning in a more sincere way. You can't brute-force your way through
the learning process by doing everything up front. You need time to rest between lessons, so everything you've learned can "lock in"[^brain]. Put another way, most people aren't going to get 30 hours better at playing the piano if those 30 hours of practice are spread over only 3 days. Time spent is only part of the puzzle- consistency is another.

[^brain]:
    I'm not about to go study the neurology of memory in order to make this claim
    more accurate. Intuitively, this is how learning works; I think that's fair to say.

But if you'd prefer a snappier version of the claim:

### With **20 minutes a day** over **30 days**, you can be conversational in Toki Pona!

But wait- [news organizations](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/07/toki-pona-smallest-language/398363/) and [research publications](https://jalt-publications.org/sites/default/files/pdf-article/jalt2023-pcp-027.pdf) and [youtubers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_d6bGAw5yt8&t=16s) have been claiming it takes **30 hours** to learn Toki Pona **since 2015**, years before we had this evidence. They even claim a "general consensus among the community." What?

## Where did "30 hours" come from?

The earliest source actually surprised me. The 30 hour claim _does_ come from the community, but not so much from consensus.

jan Mato, an early member of the Toki Pona community[^jan_mato_membership], posted [this thread](http://forums.tokipona.org/viewtopic.php?t=1801) asking everyone how many hours it took them to learn Toki Pona. The thread got five responses, and in the first of these, aikidave suggests the following figure for themselves:

[^jan_mato_membership]:
    jan Mato seems to have been active from December 2009 to mid 2013,
    with much more sporadic activity afterwards. They do [reference the mailing list](http://forums.tokipona.org/viewtopic.php?p=10777&hilit=technology+mailing#p10777)
    though, so they may have been around in the Yahoo Groups days (2002-2009).

> I spent on average, about 45 minutes per day studying toki pona, so that means it took me about 30 hours to 'learn' toki pona.

Note: this quote portrays those 30 hours as study-hours, as in the amount of time you
spend with your nose down to study. This is a huge contrast to the way those 30
hours are sold in various
articles and videos today: 30 hours from introduction to fluency.

Continuing: jan Mato [repeated](http://forums.tokipona.org/viewtopic.php?p=10574&hilit=30+hours#p10574) [this](http://forums.tokipona.org/viewtopic.php?p=10777&hilit=30+hours#p10777) [claim](http://forums.tokipona.org/viewtopic.php?p=11117&hilit=30+hours#p11117) a few more times throughout 2011, and that was almost the end of it! The 30 hour claim never showed up on the forum again.

But in January 2015, [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jan/08/toki-pona-invented-language-memrise) posted an article discussing a small group attempting to learn toki pona in 48 hours, led by Oliver Mayeux and Marta Krzeminska. This doesn't include the specific "30 hour" claim[^mental_floss]- if anything, their article is an honest and realistic portrayal of what your first two days of learning Toki Pona could be like. But this article is important because it would be a turning point for Toki Pona itself: Toki Pona was starting to get more public attention.

[^mental_floss]: Uh, [this Mental Floss article](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/66403/language-only-123-words-less-more) actually cites the Guardian article, directly on the words "around 30 hours." I have no idea why, because the Guardian article does not make that claim at all.

Later, in July 2015, [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/07/toki-pona-smallest-language/398363/) [(\*cough\*)](https://www.archivebuttons.com/articles?article=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/07/toki-pona-smallest-language/398363/) posted their own article about Toki Pona[^business_insider]. In it, they interview both Sonja Lang and Marta Krzeminska[^best_friend]- one of the organizers from the Guardian Article. Here, the author makes the 30 hour claim. With no citation.

[^business_insider]:
    The author of the Atlantic article seems to have also re-published his article in
    [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-worlds-smallest-language-has-only-100-words-and-you-can-say-almost-anything-2015-7) [(\*cough\*)](https://www.archivebuttons.com/articles?article=https://www.businessinsider.com/the-worlds-smallest-language-has-only-100-words-and-you-can-say-almost-anything-2015-7) a few days later.

[^best_friend]:
    Oliver Mayeux is not interviewed for or named in the Atlantic article, but Krzeminska does
    reference speaking toki pona with her best friend- from some of the other reading I
    did along the way, I'm pretty sure that's Oliver!

> a general consensus among Toki Pona speakers is that it takes about 30 hours to master.

And note, this quote doesn't qualify those 30 hours as "study-hours."

After this publication, [other](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/66403/language-only-123-words-less-more) [organizations](https://www.scoopwhoop.com/language/toki-pona-worlds-smallest-language/) and [podcasts](https://www.theallusionist.org/transcripts/tokipona) seem to have copied them. They include the unsupported 30 hour claim, do not qualify the 30 hours as study-hours.

There isn't any further source, so the only things left to do are speculate and see how the community dealt with this information after the fact! I've packaged my speculation below to be skipped.

<details>
<summary>Speculation</summary>

Cynically, it's easy to believe that the author of the Atlantic article searched "how long does
it take to learn toki pona" and found one of jan Mato's forum posts. The author is
writing for a fairly prestigious publication, so I wouldn't be surprised if they were nervous about citing a random forum post. Instead, don't cite the source at all!

Alternatively, it could have been Marta Krzeminska. There isn't evidence to support this
claim, but we are in speculation territory- "Marta" isn't terribly far from "Mato," and
jan Mato was the source for the 30 hour claim on the forum. Uh, that's it for evidence,
so this theory isn't looking good!

It could even have been Sonja Lang. As far as I'm aware, she has never made such a claim
either before or since, but [this Scoop Whoop article](https://www.scoopwhoop.com/language/toki-pona-worlds-smallest-language/) [warning: all the suggested articles are NSFW] _does_ attribute the 30 hour claim to her. It is also the only one to do so.

Unless the author of the Atlantic article came forward to tell us, or Marta Krzeminska turned out to be jan Mato, we'll likely never know how or why the 30 hour claim on the forum became a 30 hour claim in a professional news publication.

</details>

As for the community, they were not immune to uncritically repeating the 30 hour claim. Long after the Atlantic article was published, the 30 hour claim would re-appear in the community [in 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/tokipona/comments/5f0jzy/how_long_did_toki_pona_take_you_to_learn/ddxn7tw/) and [in 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/tokipona/comments/o3zgf5/hi_im_new_to_toki_pona_and_im_curious_about_how/h2evvhx/). Both times are differently uncertain, qualified with "or so I hear" and "IIRC I saw the figure ... somewhere."[^my_favorite]

[^my_favorite]: I think my favorite is [this one from 2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/tokipona/comments/7avyn3/learning_toki_pona/). The author says "I heard from somewhere it's around 30 hours of total work." There's no source, but these are study-hours, which is an improvement! Unfortunately, the top comment ruins this by saying: "[It took me] About a week [to become fluent]"

It's unclear what impact this misinformation has on Toki Pona. Some newcomers are [drawn in by the claim](https://www.reddit.com/r/tokipona/comments/14vse6g/toki_mi_jan_kaan_mi_olin_toki_jan_sorry_for/jreces8/), but there's no telling how many [frustrated learners](https://www.reddit.com/r/tokipona/comments/1dsi4q1/things_you_wish_you_knew_when_you_started/lb4d0mj/) gave up and never came back because they couldn't understand any Toki Pona on their second day learning. There are also plenty of well-meaning learners who [accidentally put down other learners](https://www.reddit.com/r/tokipona/comments/1d4rm61/how_long_have_you_guys_been_learning_toki_pona/l6hz5qv/).

I'd like to help this situation. To do that, let's pick apart what "30 hours" means- not
just literally, but as it would be understood by those reading it too.

## What does "30 hours" mean?

As I've alluded to, the claim that "You can learn Toki Pona in 30 hours!" is misleading. The challenge is in understanding how it's misleading. The truth is, there was never a single number that correctly described how long it takes to learn Toki Pona, or any language.

The first number is the amount of time you spend immersed in or studying the language, the "study-hours" I've referred to. For example, you'll often see claims that learning Japanese takes [100 hours, or 325-600 hours, or 3000-4800 hours](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/8pq4w9/how_long_to_learn_japanese/), depending on what your goal is. This figure is generally given in hours.

The second number is how much time those study-hours are spread over. For example,
you'll see claims that learning Japanese takes 6 months, or 1-2 years, or even
sillier-sounding claims like "7 years" and "24 years." This figure is generally given in
months or years, and is loosely linked to the study-hours figure by how many hours you
spend studying per day.

But even understanding that the "30 hours" claim was missing context, there is still more missing context. The "30 hours" are study-hours, but what does "learn" mean? It could range from "knows the words" to "conversational" to "fluent," and even "fluency" can be understood differently from person to person. When the 30 hour claim was first made on the forum, "learn" was quoted to indicate its dubious meaning- "learn" could have meant "become conversational" or even as little as "make some sentences." Either way, these are wildly different from the "mastery" or "fluency" claim that appears in so many articles.

When the "30 hours" claim appears in various publications, especially after the Atlantic article, there doesn't seem to be any care taken for how the reader would interpret the claim. There is no context given for those 30 hours. The articles do not specify how long you might take to get through those 30 hours, and they provide either no understanding or a badly misinformed understanding of what you'll achieve by the end of those 30 hours.

This issue is made even worse by the fact that Toki Pona is a "small" language, or "minimalist" language, or "the world's smallest" language. These, while mostly accurate on their own, make the 30 hour claim even more misleading by adding legitimacy to the "30 hours to fluency" claim. If the language is so small, it makes perfect sense that you can learn it so fast! Except that isn't true at all.

It would have been more _honest_ to say that those 30 hours were over the course of a
few weeks or months, or at least that they were 30 hours of studying. But many
publications let readers come away with the belief that "you can learn toki pona in 30
hours," where the reader will likely understand "30 hours" as "basically two days."

The only solution to this is to include all the context you can, every time you make
this claim. At minimum:

- It takes at least 10 hours of study over 30 days, structured as 20 minutes per day.
- There's only one learning method, [comprehensible input](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwYL9_SRAk8EXSZPSTm9lm2kD_Z1RzUgm), that is known to work in that
  time frame.
- You'll only get to a "conversational" level of Toki Pona with this amount of time and effort.
- Your personal results could be different!

And if you must put flashy numbers on how long it takes to learn Toki Pona, "conversational in 10 hours over 30 days" or "20 minutes per day for 30 days to be conversational" is as good as it's going to get.

If all you wanted was the answer to the question in the title, you're good to go!

Sonja recently posted [that specific research publication](https://jalt-publications.org/sites/default/files/pdf-article/jalt2023-pcp-027.pdf), which follows a small group of Japanese students and professors as they learned Toki Pona. About two minutes into reading it, I got smacked in the face by this classic bit of misinformation:

> It is generally said to take only 30 hours to learn (Yuzbay, 2023).

Does following that trail lead us anywhere useful?

Following that citation brings you to [this Medium article by Elvira Yuzbay](https://elvirayuzbay.medium.com/how-much-can-you-say-with-137-words-18e80d47fbb), published January 27th 2023:

> It is estimated that it takes roughly 30 hours to master the language.

But she didn't provide any citation, so the trail immediately runs cold. Oops. But naturally,
we can [google](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_(verb)>) it.

Googling [toki pona "30 hours"](https://www.google.com/search?q=toki+pona+%2230+hours%22) takes you to several more uncited sources, such as [this reddit comment from 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/tokipona/comments/o3zgf5/hi_im_new_to_toki_pona_and_im_curious_about_how/h2evvhx/) and [this one from 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/tokipona/comments/5f0jzy/how_long_did_toki_pona_take_you_to_learn/ddxn7tw/).

> IIRC I saw the figure 30 hours for intermediate level reading and writing somewhere.

> The average time is around 30 hours or so I hear

You'll note that both of these comments make the same 30 hour claim with differing levels of certainty. I should stress: This is the sort of information that, if it had a source, would be trivial to search for and post a link to. I'd go even further and claim that, if such a study existed, Toki Pona would be in the news way more often.

Let's go further, then:

[June 27th 2017 in Jagran Josh](https://www.jagranjosh.com/general-knowledge/do-you-know-about-worlds-smallest-language-1498569438-1), which appears to be a news organization but named after and run by one person?:

No citation.

This one attributes the claim to Sonja Lang (and directly links her personal facebook
profile???? what???????), but doesn't specify where she supposedly made that claim.

[November 19th 2015 in The Allusionist](https://www.theallusionist.org/transcripts/tokipona):

> apparently you can become fluent in it with around 30 hours’ study.

This is a transcript of an interview with Sonja. You'd think that, if she made the 30
hour claim, it would be here? But nope, the interviewer says it, and Sonja doesn't say
anything about it.

[July 20th 2015 in Mental Floss](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/66403/language-only-123-words-less-more):

This one has a citation to [this January 8th 2015 article in The Guardian] linked on the
phrase "around 30 hours", but that article does not make the specific 30 hour claim at all! And to be sure, [it hasn't been edited since its publication](https://web.archive.org/web/20150108222332/https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jan/08/toki-pona-invented-language-memrise).

I will grant, this article does indirectly claim you can make sentences and communicate by your second day of speaking Toki Pona. Honestly, that's probably true

Before we continue, I need note

as an aside: there are genuinely dozens of other news articles which parrot the same "general consensus" and "30 hours" data points. searching "toki pona" "30 hours" will show you articles from mental floss, the allusionist, that same atlantic article, a podcast called "this is criminal"

but the earliest source i can find is [here on the toki pona forum in january 2011](http://forums.tokipona.org/viewtopic.php?p=9984&hilit=about%2030%20hours#p9984)

> I spent on average, about 45 minutes per day studying toki pona, so that means it took me about 30 hours to 'learn' toki pona. (I was never any good at learning languages!)

the interesting thing about the comment is that the 30 hours is not portrayed as "30 hours from introduction to understanding" as the "30 hours" bit tends to be read, but instead as 30 hours _studying_! which, for achieving a basic level of conversational, might be achievable! like, my course and jan Telakoman's course combined are shorter than that, and telakoman has literal proof of the effectiveness of his course in several videos with those who took the 30 day challenge.

but i think [_this_ is the original source](http://forums.tokipona.org/viewtopic.php?p=11117&hilit=30%20hours%20according%20survey#p11117)

> You can learn all there is in about 30 hours of study (according to the survey on the forum)
> jan Mato references a "survey on the forum" which, if i'm not mistaken, is their own thread that i linked above in which... exactly one person said it took them 30 hours of study.

Although, it may be that they're referencing the [handful](http://forums.tokipona.org/viewtopic.php?p=10421&hilit=hours%20study#p10421) of [times](http://forums.tokipona.org/viewtopic.php?p=11337&hilit=hours%20study#p11337) they asked people too?

But they referenced the 30 hours bit [here in June 2011](http://forums.tokipona.org/viewtopic.php?p=10777&hilit=30%20hours#p10777), so I'm genuinely not sure!

In summary, uhh, one guy said it took him 30 hours to learn toki pona, jan Mato took that super seriously without much further evidence, and at some point news organizations began laundering that up to the point of being fact. Cynically, I'd assume whichever one of those previously mentioned news organizations just googled "How long does it take to learn toki pona" and found the exact posts by jan Mato that I was looking at, but didn't care to look any closer.
