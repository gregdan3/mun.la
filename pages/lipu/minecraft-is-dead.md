- Minecraft is dead. Long live Minecraft.
  - beta
  - extreme focus on inventory management when exploring
  - health is rare and valuable
  - enemies are not too threatening, but hits are expensive
  - high skill is rewarded with being able to explore more
  - not intentional, but many charming bugs to exploit
- Minecraft is dead. Long live Minecraft.
  - beta 1.8 through release 1.0
  - the addition of stackable food and the hunger bar
  - inventory management disappears in favor of high preparedness
  - engagements are less expensive, you always recover even mid fight
  - the game's sandbox means you can escape fights, recover, and get back in
  - two new structures where only dungeons were before: mineshafts and strongholds.
    - Both are out of the way, hidden underground same as dungeons.
  - note: a hint of this increasing ease first appeared with the bed in Beta 1.4
- Minecraft is dead. Long live Minecraft.
  - release 1.7
  - the massive world generator changes
  - previously the world was naturalistic
    - Structures and more complex, detailed biomes begin to take the focus of the game away from creativity.
    - dungeons were the only structure, and they were meant to blend into caves and be run down.
    - villages were a welcome and infrequent addition
  - Adding to the beauty of the world meant seeing blocky natural world through a creative lens.
  - Note: the first structures came in release too, but the only one of these that was above ground was villages
    - villages were uh, basic.
- Minecraft is dead. Long live Minecraft.
  - release 1.9
  - combat update
- Minecraft is dead. Long live Minecraft.
  - release 1.14
  - pillagers and their mechanics
  - this permanently changes the way the player interacts with structures
  - the player is punished for interacting with certain structures
    - this punishment is mechanical rather than through negligence i.e. traps/spawners!
    - pillagers in their design language are actors, where mobs are more incidental to your presence
- Minecraft is dead. Long live Minecraft.
  - It's 2010. You've been watching a Let's Player do Minecraft videos for weeks.
  - You convince your mom to buy you the game, you get it just a few weeks before the Halloween update drops.
  - You make a world, remembering how to make a crafting bench, tools, chests from the many videos.
  - You make a small shack outside a cave, and hide at night away from all the mobs.
  - Your mom brings you a snack. You spend hours lost in the tunnels, and find your first diamonds.

for ending block:

- Minecraft is dead. Long live Minecraft.
  - It's 2013. That block game you played so much just got mentioned on Southpark.
- Minecraft is dead. Long live Minecraft.
  - It's 2015. Minecraft was just bought by Microsoft. You haven't thought about the game in years.
- Minecraft is dead. Long live Minecraft.
  - It's 2018. Minecraft is back.

mention video by SalC1?

here's my shortlist of the most influential updates the game has ever had, with them (correctly) increasing in scope over time

- alpha 1.0 (redstone)
- alpha 1.2 (biomes and nether)
- beta 1.4 (beds)
- release (beta 1.8 and 1.9 kinda blend together here)
  - shoutout to snapshots during this time, permanent fixture of the game!
- 1.7 (world gen rework with tons of new biomes)
- 1.9 (which is still maligned TO THIS DAY, the combat update)
- 1.14 (pillagers, the additional structures of the world tip from "exciting discoveries" to "engagement mechanics that limit and distract the player"

- 1.19.1 (reporting bullshit)

ok i am now convinced that 1.16 is also an influential update for one simple reason
the addition of netherite, removing diamonds as the peak of the game's progression (enchanting obviously being a sidegrade to any level of progression) and permanently altering the iconography of the game
