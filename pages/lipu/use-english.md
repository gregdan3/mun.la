## What?

If you're making or growing a toki pona community, you should **use English** to advertise events, create hype, share excitement, do outreach, and otherwise interest people in speaking Toki Pona! Once that's done, speak toki pona all the rest of the time- don't let English steal good topics from toki pona!

This applies to any other language, not just English! But there isn't a snappy way to say "a language other than toki pona which is spoken by those you're reaching out to." I refer to English throughout the rest of this article, but understand it applies to any language.

If all you wanted was the advice from the headline, you're good to go! The rest of this article is the collected observations of myself and others, my analysis of these observations, and my conclusions that lead me to recommend the above. Thanks!

## Why?

Like, why would you care to take this advice in the first place? 

### The community wants more toki pona

Within the community, there are many speakers who want more opportunities to speak toki pona.
There are frequent complaints about English entirely consuming conversations, and
about being ignored when attempting to speak toki pona in a conversation that is currently primarily in English.

To those who joined the community to speak toki pona, this is deeply frustrating. It is 


This is especially true of toki pona's most invested speakers, who love the language dearly. Both of these groups would like to use toki pona in new ways, to explore what it is capable of, and challenge themselves to learn more about new topics in new conversations- among any number of other personal motivations for speaking toki pona. But opportunities to actually explore the boundaries of toki pona do not come up often.

### The community is highly centralized

If community centralization is a concern to you, then my advice is important to you as
well. In short, a small number of toki pona communities account for the majority of toki pona
conversation.

From my work on [ilo Muni](https://gregdan3.github.io/ilo-muni/), I discovered that [ma pona pi toki pona](https://discord.gg/mapona) has 57.1% of all toki pona text; this covers Discord, Telegram, and Reddit. There are only a handful of platforms with large enough toki pona communities to make a dent in this figure- namely, Facebook, Tumblr, and YouTube. Even then, I'd expect ma pona pi toki pona to only barely lose its majority with these platforms added.

However, ma pona pi toki pona is only 50.4% of toki pona sentences in the past year
(August 2023 to August 2024). This is still a majority, but a much smaller one, and much more
likely to be toppled by the addition of the missing platforms. This shift is because
toki pona speakers are making more communities than ever before, and because more of
these communities are successful than ever before. These two are, in turn, caused by there
being **more toki pona speakers** with more diverse interests and desires than ever before.

<summary>**Why is ma pona pi toki pona so large?**</summary>

Additionally, the 'blame' for the size of ma pona pi toki pona is not solely on it. It's a matter of platform
design, and how different platforms encourage different conversation. In ilo Muni's
data, Discord makes up
91.1% of all written toki pona, likely due to its design encouraging 
fast-paced live and continuous conversation. Among all the popular platforms where toki
pona is spoken, only Telegram comes close to this design

While Telegram is fairly similar to Discord in encouraging
many short messages, it is much less adopted in the community. Reddit, Facebook, and Tumblr all encourage 


Of course, a much larger centralization problem is Discord as a platform, which is 91.1% of all of my data. I'm working on gathering more, but to be frank, there simply isn't enough written toki pona left on the internet to make a dent in this figure.

Also, 



If there were more toki pona speakers, especially skilled ones, there would be
more communities to match- this is already an observably true if small effect. This may
not make a difference in platform centralization, since that's governed by entirely
different phenomena, but it would make a difference in community centralization.

## Challenges

### English isn't going away

For better or worse, English is the primary language of many of toki pona's speakers.
There are plenty of spaces which only allow toki pona, or at least cordon off English to
a small corner of the space, but these tend to lack focus, activity, or even participants in many cases.
The most successful spaces in terms of raw activity are those where English is the
primary language, but it would be better to frame "success" in terms of the amount of
toki pona spoken. In that case, the most successful spaces are still those where English
the primary language- there just happens to be enough Toki Pona going on at the same
time. 



### Most conversations about toki pona are to study it

This is true for both learners and experienced speakers, where learners are using a
language they already know to study toki pona, and experienced speakers are discussing
specific ways they and others use toki pona... in English. While learners are ([mostly](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwYL9_SRAk8EXSZPSTm9lm2kD_Z1RzUgm)) off the hook for using English to learn, experienced speakers using English is what we're here to discuss!

### Most conversations about toki pona do not change it

Or stated more aptly, most conversations _about_ toki pona do not further what is possible in it- there is only so much you can do to influence a language without speaking it!

Learner conversations can't influence toki pona much, because learners need a base understanding of toki pona before furthering the language- or to even know what to further.

But even for experienced speakers, most of their conversations about toki pona are studies, analyses, or explorations- all in English. These almost never make their way to toki pona, whether as conversations or usage. Put another way, English conversation about the use of toki pona rivals how much toki pona is actually used, _and_ doesn't influence toki pona very much.

This isn't to say these conversations have _no_ influence. If nothing else, these conversations are an important part of how people explore and enjoy toki pona, and have been for as long as I've been around- I've been a part of that too! But that isn't the full story, because there are many more ways to engage with toki pona that _do_ influence it and lead to both greater and _new_ understanding.

### Using English takes topics away from toki pona

If a topic is first discussed in a language other than toki pona, there's no reason to discuss it in toki pona anymore.

If all of those who would be interested in a given topic (e.g. a new analysis of toki pona) engage with it in English first, why would they re-engage with it in toki pona, or have later conversations about it in toki pona? Reiterating the initial conversation would be akin to a translation exercise- not a conversation unto itself. That's great for learners, but often boring for experienced speakers!

Every conversation in English, especially those which study toki pona, takes away a discussion that could have been in toki pona. This isn't to say that _every_ conversation needs to be in toki pona- but many that could _easily_ be in toki pona are not.

### Speaking toki pona sees low engagement

Or stated conversely, English is easy and toki pona is hard.

This is an issue that the community and its members frequently run into. I've seen easily dozens of independent realizations of this fact.

## Realizations

### Studying toki pona in English limits toki pona and you

If you're a learner, this section doesn't apply to you so much, although I recommend
learning from [o pilin e toki pona](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwYL9_SRAk8EXSZPSTm9lm2kD_Z1RzUgm) if you'd like to take my advice as hard as you can!

If you're an experienced speaker, I strongly believe that using English to study toki pona is a
limit for you, for your skill in the language, and maybe even your long term interest in the language. Studying toki pona via English means removing a
topic of conversation from toki pona, and thus removing an opportunity to challenge
yourself and learn more about toki pona.

If you're interested in toki pona as an object of research,
having those discussions or displaying your results in
English means the exact same thing for you, but from a different angle: Your object of
study will ultimately be less interesting than it could be. Your studies will draw
interest from active speakers, but they'll have those discussions with you in English-
you didn't create an opportunity for them to speak toki pona, so toki pona did not grow.

### Summary

- Most conversations about toki pona are to study it.
- Most conversations studying toki pona are in English.
- If you're studying toki pona in English, you probably aren't influencing the language
  much.
-
- But despite all of the above points, it's

## My Advice

Use English as a tool. If you're making a cool project, a new study, more lesson
material- you should get people excited about your work by initially sharing it in
English! But once that's done, you should

## Other notes

### "toki pona taso is a dead-end ideology"

This is a quote from jan Olipija, who happen to discuss this topic with jan Lakuse and
jan Tepo a few days before I had a very similar conversation with kala Asi. It was
pretty funny to find!

In reading, we're on a similar page about the challenges toki pona has faced in being
its own language and having its own identity, but I don't fully agree with her
diagnosis.

If I understood her correctly, her
imagining of a future toki pona community is primarily bi-lingual

### Aren't you using English right now?

Yep! This article is for those who primarily use English to discuss toki pona.
