## Explainer

###

The Toki Pona community has essentially solved the beginning stage of learning.
There are tons of resources, regular opportunities to practice translation, and
many spaces to ask questions! There will always be room to do better, but the
size of the community speaks for itself- if somebody wants to become
conversational in toki pona, they won't have any trouble achieving that.

However, there is a persistent gap in the learning process for anyone wanting to
be more than just conversational in toki pona. Outside of a few specific spaces,
or the direct vicinity of already skilled speakers, there are very few
opportunities to listen to or speak toki pona above a conversational level.
Having observed the community for over three years and done event running in the
community for over two years, I'd describe the causes like so:

- **Communities and languages are not conversations.** A community is a space
  where conversation takes place, and languages are mediums of conversation. You
  can learn all of the basics of toki pona with a list of words, grammar rules,
  and lots of sentences to practice on- but you need conversations, something to
  talk about, to really get good!
- **Most members of the community are learners**, making it hard to find
  somebody to talk to above that basic level of conversational. You can get
  through this barrier without that help- that has to be true, because toki pona
  didn't exist before 2001! But this creates another problem:
- **Most members of the community speak English**, so there is massive pressure
  to fall back on English for understanding- especially among learners. In
  spaces where English is allowed, universally end up speaking almost entirely
  English- it often doesn't matter if toki pona is encouraged, but not required
  in this space[^mapona].
- **Events make great conversation, but are hard.** Collectively, we lack
  experience _and_ have high expectations for ourselves and the events we run.
  Despite that, many of us have never run an event before and don't know where
  to start. Often, we assume that every event should run like a perfectly tuned
  [Rube Goldberg machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine),
  running flawlessly from start to finish with something captivating happening
  at every moment. We want every event to be [suno pi toki pona]{.tp}, but that isn't
  realistic.
- **Nobody wants to be excluded!** If you make a space or event which only
  allows Toki Pona, a lot of people will simply never join. There are tons of
  reasons for this, but most boil down to feeling unable to participate, such as
  feeling unconfident, unskilled, or uninvited.

[^mapona]:
    [ma pona pi toki pona]{.tp} has actually had huge success in getting people
    to speak toki pona. There isn't one clear cause, but I'd most attribute this
    most to the space now (as of May 2024) offering specific topics for
    conversations in its design. That said, there are still some failure points-
    I've only observed it in the general chat, but some members of the server
    push back on the idea of speaking toki pona literally ever. Buuuut, once the
    general chat calmed down for a while, those present would routinely speak
    toki pona in the channel!

<!--reinforcing the pressure to speak English. Unless specific steps are taken to-->
<!--create spaces and events for toki pona speakers, almost everyone who shows up is-->
<!--going to speak English and not toki pona- and this makes every event into a de-->
<!--facto learner event!-->

To address the above, we should first delineate which of these are solvable
problems, and which are unsolvable.

- **We cannot help the fact that communities and languages only facilitate
  conversation.** Talking about toki pona is extremely fun, but it isn't to
  everyone's taste, and it only goes so far. After that, you need something new
  to talk about.
- **We cannot help the fact that most of the community is learners.** toki pona
  is fascinating to the right type of person, and we draw in that sort of person
  all the time! The reality is, the community's skilled speakers may _always_ be
  outnumbered by new learners, and there is only so much we can do to close that
  gap with education.

- **We can help the fact that most of the community speaks English**, but that
  is not my focus for this article. I do briefly discuss the issue and how to
  address it in this footnote[^english-speakers], but I believe the other
  problems are either more important to solve first or lead to helping this
  anyway.
- **We can help the fact that running events is hard.** Events do not _have_ to
  be hard- we just have to plan simpler events. I've personally run several
  events in [ma pona pi toki pona]{.tp}, and dozens in [ma toki pona
  [wile.jan.]]{.tp}- the former is exhausting and prone to error, while the
  latter is comfortable and easy. In my opinion, the difference is in
  preparation, expectation, and help.
- **We can help people to not feel excluded**, up to a point. Events can be
  designed in such a way that, even though they are "toki pona only," they can
  be accessible to learners- not only to listen to, but to participate in! We
  can't bridge this gap for everyone, but we can absolutely do better.

[english-speakers]: It would take a long time and a lot of effort to change the
fact that most of the community speaks English- it's also possible this literal
fact will never change. But its consequences could change. The reason the
community is primarily English speaking is that most resources for learning toki
pona are in English, and most of the community is English speaking. Changing
this would mean creating more learning materials in languages other than
English, and discouraging English from use- which can at least be done with toki
pona itself!

Given all of this, do you think we could run **more, better, and easier events**
which **require toki pona** but are still **accessible to learners?**

## How to do better

### Event Running is easier than you think

There is an instinct to be massively over-prepared for running an event. Newbies
to event running often want to get lists of every participant, put them into an
exact order, know what they're doing ahead of time, create tons of advertising
materials, and even plan the entire _next_ entire event in advance.

It is true that you need to be prepared to run an event, but you'd be surprised
at how little you _need_ in order to be ready! For most purposes, these are your
only _necessary_ responsibilities:

- Have something to do during the event!
- Choose what day and time the event starts!
- Remind everyone that the event is coming up to build hype!
- Be present during the event to make sure things run smoothly!

And then you have a few _optional_ responsibilities:

- Start with something exciting!
- End with something exciting!
- Have an incentive for participating, like a contest with rewards or an
  opportunity for community-wide exposure and recognition!

If you've participated in [suno pi toki pona]{.tp} before, you'll notice that it
meets all of these requirements fantastically, but it is also **very** planned out
ahead of time. You don't need **Don't try to create [suno pi toki pona]{.tp}!!**

### Speaking Toki Pona is easier than you think

### "Only Toki Pona" is more flexible than you think

There is a reflex from especially skilled and invested speakers of Toki Pona to
seriously over-correct, enforcing that only Toki Pona is used for entire events
or communities. It is their prerogative to do so, and I respect the effort- Toki
Pona is capable of any conversation you need it for, and we should not
artifically limit it out of a mistaken belief that Toki Pona _isn't_ capable.

However, we need to be realistic on this point: Just because _you personally_
can use toki pona to express anything, does not mean everyone else can do so- a
huge number of people in the community are in the learning process, and will
still need help

To encourage people to speak toki pona, you should **use English as a tool** to
advertise events, create hype, and share excitement. Then, once that's done,
**speak only toki pona** for the entire event! This way, you cast **as wide a
net as possible** for your target audience, bringing in interested people who
may not be confident enough in their toki pona skill to follow the announcement.

And to be clear: the event **has to be only toki pona**! But that line is
malleable- you can keep casting a wide net by making a space where other
languages can be spoken while the main event remains only toki pona. Discord
voice chats are a great example of this, since the voice chat can be in toki
pona while the text chat is in English for learners to ask questions.

<!--If you speak Toki Pona and you're growing an existing community, making a new community, or planning events and outreach, **use English** to advertise events, create hype, share excitement, and otherwise interest people in speaking Toki Pona! Once that's done, speak **only toki pona** all the rest of the time- don't let your hype go to waste!-->

## Questions and Clarifications

### What if my event is for learners?

Do what you want! I have thoughts about how best to design an event for totally
new learners, but the focus of this article is creating opportunities to speak
toki pona at an intermediate and advanced level.

### Why does it need to be **only** toki pona?

There are a few other ways that the toki pona community organizes events.
Summarizing them:

- Just an event, without any specific language required.
-

### Does the **entire** event need to be only toki pona?

## Considerations

### English isn't going away

For better or worse, English is the primary language of many Toki Pona speakers.
There are plenty of spaces which only allow toki pona, or at least cordon off
English to a small corner of the space, but these tend to lack focus, activity,
or even participants in many cases.

The largest and most active Toki Pona spaces are so large and active because
most of their activity is in English. These communities undoubtedly are
successful in growing interest in Toki Pona, but they very rarely take that next
step of growing Toki Pona's _use_.

But if we consider a space to be successful because it encourages the most _use_
of Toki Pona, these much larger English-first spaces are still the most
successful communities, encouraging the most volume

Conversely, the spaces which only allow Toki Pona are much quieter- they aren't
dead, but they tend to be occupied by a small number of more invested Toki Pona
speakers who are willing to put up with limited activity in order to not have
English influence or interrupt conversations.

If we'd like to bridge this gap, we should accept that English is a part of the
community and use it as a tool to grow Toki Pona.

### English takes topics away from toki pona

If you're in a group of Toki Pona speakers, and you discuss something in
English, none of you will ever end up having that discussion in Toki Pona later.
After all, why would you? Reiterating the initial conversation would be akin to
a translation exercise- not a conversation unto itself. That's great for
learners, but often boring for experienced speakers!

Every conversation in English, especially those which study toki pona, takes
away a discussion that could have been in toki pona. This isn't to say that
_every_ conversation needs to be in toki pona- but many that could _easily_ be
in toki pona are not.

A common example would be conversations that study Toki Pona. Broadly speaking,
most conversations _about_ toki pona are to study it. This is true for both
learners and experienced speakers, where learners are using a language they
already know to study toki pona, and experienced speakers are discussing
specific ways they and others use toki pona... in English. While learners are
([mostly](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwYL9_SRAk8EXSZPSTm9lm2kD_Z1RzUgm))
off the hook for using English to learn, experienced speakers have no excuse!

You might think this isn't a problem- those conversations are just as much using
English as a tool to grow Toki Pona as any other, right? Somebody is

The trouble is that there are _so many_ conversations about Toki Pona which are
not _in_ it, to the point that several turns of phrase have developed to refer
to these conversations, such as the phrase "nasin discussion."

### The community wants more toki pona

Within the community, there are many speakers who want more opportunities to
speak toki pona. There are frequent complaints about English entirely consuming
conversations, and about being ignored when attempting to speak toki pona in a
conversation that is currently primarily in English.

To those who joined the community to speak toki pona, this is deeply
frustrating. It is

This is especially true of toki pona's most invested speakers, who love the
language dearly. Both of these groups would like to use toki pona in new ways,
to explore what it is capable of, and challenge themselves to learn more about
new topics in new conversations- among any number of other personal motivations
for speaking toki pona. But opportunities to actually explore the boundaries of
toki pona do not come up often.

<!-- ### The community is highly centralized -->
<!---->
<!-- If community centralization is a concern to you, then my advice is important to you as -->
<!-- well. In short, a small number of toki pona communities account for the majority of toki pona -->
<!-- conversation. -->
<!---->
<!-- From my work on [ilo Muni](https://gregdan3.github.io/ilo-muni/), I discovered that [ma pona pi toki pona](https://discord.gg/mapona) has 57.1% of all toki pona text; this covers Discord, Telegram, and Reddit. There are only a handful of platforms with large enough toki pona communities to make a dent in this figure- namely, Facebook, Tumblr, and YouTube. Even then, I'd expect ma pona pi toki pona to only barely lose its majority with these platforms added. -->

<!-- However, ma pona pi toki pona is only 50.4% of toki pona sentences in the past year -->
<!-- (August 2023 to August 2024). This is still a majority, but a much smaller one, and much more -->
<!-- likely to be toppled by the addition of the missing platforms. This shift is because -->
<!-- toki pona speakers are making more communities than ever before, and because more of -->
<!-- these communities are successful than ever before. These two are, in turn, caused by there -->

<!-- <summary>**Why is ma pona pi toki pona so large?**</summary> -->

<!-- Additionally, the 'blame' for the size of ma pona pi toki pona is not solely on it. It's a matter of platform -->
<!-- design, and how different platforms encourage different conversation. In ilo Muni's -->

<!-- 91.1% of all written toki pona, likely due to its design encouraging -->

<!-- many short messages, it is much less adopted in the community. Reddit, Facebook, and Tumblr all encourage -->

<!-- Of course, a much larger centralization problem is Discord as a platform, which is 91.1% of all of my data. I'm working on gathering more, but to be frank, there simply isn't enough written toki pona left on the internet to make a dent in this figure. -->

### English is easy, Toki Pona is hard

Or alternatively, speaking Toki Pona is low engagement, because the average
reader is not skilled enough in Toki Pona to read it as quickly as they would
read an equivalent English statement-

This is an issue that the community and its members frequently run into. I've
seen easily dozens of independent realizations of this fact.

<!-- ### Most conversations about toki pona do not change it -->
<!---->
<!-- Or stated more aptly, most conversations _about_ toki pona do not further what is possible in it- there is only so much you can do to influence a language without speaking it! -->
<!---->
<!-- Learner conversations can't influence toki pona much, because learners need a base understanding of toki pona before furthering the language- or to even know what to further. -->
<!---->
<!-- But even for experienced speakers, most of their conversations about toki pona are studies, analyses, or explorations- all in English. These almost never make their way to toki pona, whether as conversations or usage. Put another way, English conversation about the use of toki pona rivals how much toki pona is actually used, _and_ doesn't influence toki pona very much. -->
<!---->
<!-- This isn't to say these conversations have _no_ influence. If nothing else, these conversations are an important part of how people explore and enjoy toki pona, and have been for as long as I've been around- I've been a part of that too! But that isn't the full story, because there are many more ways to engage with toki pona that _do_ influence it and lead to both greater and _new_ understanding. -->

<!-- ## Realizations -->

<!-- ### Studying toki pona in English limits toki pona and you -->
<!---->
<!-- If you're a learner, this section doesn't apply to you so much, although I recommend -->
<!-- learning from [o pilin e toki pona](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwYL9_SRAk8EXSZPSTm9lm2kD_Z1RzUgm) if you'd like to take my advice as hard as you can! -->
<!---->
<!-- If you're an experienced speaker, I strongly believe that using English to study toki pona is a -->
<!-- limit for you, for your skill in the language, and maybe even your long term interest in the language. Studying toki pona via English means removing a -->
<!-- topic of conversation from toki pona, and thus removing an opportunity to challenge -->
<!-- yourself and learn more about toki pona. -->
<!---->
<!-- If you're interested in toki pona as an object of research, -->
<!-- having those discussions or displaying your results in -->
<!-- English means the exact same thing for you, but from a different angle: Your object of -->
<!-- study will ultimately be less interesting than it could be. Your studies will draw -->
<!-- interest from active speakers, but they'll have those discussions with you in English- -->
<!-- you didn't create an opportunity for them to speak toki pona, so toki pona did not grow. -->

<!-- ### Summary -->
<!---->
<!-- - Most conversations about toki pona are to study it. -->
<!-- - Most conversations studying toki pona are in English. -->
