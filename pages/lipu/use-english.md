## What?

If you're growing or newly making a toki pona community, **use English** to advertise events, create hype, share excitement, and otherwise interest people in speaking Toki Pona! Once that's done, speak toki pona all the rest of the time- don't let your hype go to waste!

<!-- - it's okay to speak English as a means to -->
<!-- don't let English steal good topics from toki pona! -->

Put another way, English should be used as a _tool_ to create opportunities to learn and speak Toki Pona.

You can apply this advice to any language, not just English, but I focus on
English for reasons I explain in the first section of this article.

But if all you wanted was the advice from the headline, you're good to go! The rest of this article is the is the collected observations of myself and others, and how those lead me to offer the above advice. Enjoy!

## Why?

Like, why would you care to take this advice in the first place?

### English isn't going away

For better or worse, English is the primary language of many Toki Pona speakers.
There are plenty of spaces which only allow toki pona, or at least cordon off English to
a small corner of the space, but these tend to lack focus, activity, or even participants in many cases.

The largest and most active Toki Pona spaces are so large and active because
most of their activity is in English. These communities undoubtedly are
successful in growing interest in Toki Pona, but they very rarely take that next
step of growing Toki Pona's _use_.

But if we consider a space to be successful because it encourages the most
_use_ of Toki Pona, these much larger English-first spaces are still the most
successful communities, encouraging the most volume

Conversely, the spaces which only allow Toki Pona are much quieter- they aren't
dead, but they tend to be occupied by a small number of more invested Toki Pona
speakers who are willing to put up with limited activity in order to not have
English influence or interrupt conversations.

If we'd like to bridge this gap, we should accept that English is a part of the
community and use it as a tool to grow Toki Pona.

### English takes topics away from toki pona

If you're in a group of Toki Pona speakers, and you discuss something in
English, none of you will ever end up having that discussion in Toki Pona later. After all, why would you? Reiterating the initial conversation would be akin to a translation exercise- not a conversation unto itself. That's great for learners, but often boring for experienced speakers!

Every conversation in English, especially those which study toki pona, takes away a discussion that could have been in toki pona. This isn't to say that _every_ conversation needs to be in toki pona- but many that could _easily_ be in toki pona are not.

A common example would be conversations that study Toki Pona. Broadly speaking, most conversations *about* toki pona are to study it. This is true for both learners and experienced speakers, where learners are using a
language they already know to study toki pona, and experienced speakers are discussing
specific ways they and others use toki pona... in English. While learners are ([mostly](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwYL9_SRAk8EXSZPSTm9lm2kD_Z1RzUgm)) off the hook for using English to learn, experienced speakers have no excuse!

You might think this isn't a problem- those conversations are just as much using
English as a tool to grow Toki Pona as any other, right? Somebody is 

The trouble is that there are *so many* conversations about Toki Pona which are
not *in* it, to the point that several turns of phrase have developed to refer
to these conversations, such as the phrase "nasin discussion." 

### The community wants more toki pona

Within the community, there are many speakers who want more opportunities to speak toki pona.
There are frequent complaints about English entirely consuming conversations, and
about being ignored when attempting to speak toki pona in a conversation that is currently primarily in English.

To those who joined the community to speak toki pona, this is deeply frustrating. It is

This is especially true of toki pona's most invested speakers, who love the language dearly. Both of these groups would like to use toki pona in new ways, to explore what it is capable of, and challenge themselves to learn more about new topics in new conversations- among any number of other personal motivations for speaking toki pona. But opportunities to actually explore the boundaries of toki pona do not come up often.

<!-- ### The community is highly centralized -->
<!---->
<!-- If community centralization is a concern to you, then my advice is important to you as -->
<!-- well. In short, a small number of toki pona communities account for the majority of toki pona -->
<!-- conversation. -->
<!---->
<!-- From my work on [ilo Muni](https://gregdan3.github.io/ilo-muni/), I discovered that [ma pona pi toki pona](https://discord.gg/mapona) has 57.1% of all toki pona text; this covers Discord, Telegram, and Reddit. There are only a handful of platforms with large enough toki pona communities to make a dent in this figure- namely, Facebook, Tumblr, and YouTube. Even then, I'd expect ma pona pi toki pona to only barely lose its majority with these platforms added. -->
<!---->
<!-- However, ma pona pi toki pona is only 50.4% of toki pona sentences in the past year -->
<!-- (August 2023 to August 2024). This is still a majority, but a much smaller one, and much more -->
<!-- likely to be toppled by the addition of the missing platforms. This shift is because -->
<!-- toki pona speakers are making more communities than ever before, and because more of -->
<!-- these communities are successful than ever before. These two are, in turn, caused by there -->
<!-- being **more toki pona speakers** with more diverse interests and desires than ever before. -->
<!---->
<!-- <details> -->
<!-- <summary>**Why is ma pona pi toki pona so large?**</summary> -->
<!---->
<!-- Additionally, the 'blame' for the size of ma pona pi toki pona is not solely on it. It's a matter of platform -->
<!-- design, and how different platforms encourage different conversation. In ilo Muni's -->
<!-- data, Discord makes up -->
<!-- 91.1% of all written toki pona, likely due to its design encouraging -->
<!-- fast-paced live and continuous conversation. Among all the popular platforms where toki -->
<!-- pona is spoken, only Telegram comes close to this design -->
<!---->
<!-- While Telegram is fairly similar to Discord in encouraging -->
<!-- many short messages, it is much less adopted in the community. Reddit, Facebook, and Tumblr all encourage -->
<!---->
<!-- Of course, a much larger centralization problem is Discord as a platform, which is 91.1% of all of my data. I'm working on gathering more, but to be frank, there simply isn't enough written toki pona left on the internet to make a dent in this figure. -->

<!-- </details> -->

<!-- <details> -->
<!--   <summary>**Why not get rid of ma pona pi toki pona?**</summary> -->

<!-- </details> -->

<!-- Also, -->
<!---->
<!-- If there were more toki pona speakers, especially skilled ones, there would be -->
<!-- more communities to match- this is already an observably true if small effect. This may -->
<!-- not make a difference in platform centralization, since that's governed by entirely -->
<!-- different phenomena, but it would make a difference in community centralization. -->

## How?

### Create

### Encourage

### Run Events

### Speak Toki Pona to those who know it

## Challenges

### English is easy, Toki Pona is hard

Or alternatively, speaking Toki Pona is low engagement, because the average
reader is not skilled enough in Toki Pona to read it as quickly as they would
read an equivalent English statement- 

This is an issue that the community and its members frequently run into. I've seen easily dozens of independent realizations of this fact.

### "toki pona taso is a dead-end ideology"

There is a reflex from especially skilled and invested speakers of Toki Pona to
seriously over-correct, enforcing that only Toki Pona is used in specific
environments or communities, as well as to discuss those environments or communities. 
It is their prerogative to do so, and I respect the effort- Toki
Pona is capable of any conversation you need it for, and we should not
artifically limit it out of a mistaken belief that Toki Pona *isn't* capable.



<!-- ### Most conversations about toki pona do not change it -->
<!---->
<!-- Or stated more aptly, most conversations _about_ toki pona do not further what is possible in it- there is only so much you can do to influence a language without speaking it! -->
<!---->
<!-- Learner conversations can't influence toki pona much, because learners need a base understanding of toki pona before furthering the language- or to even know what to further. -->
<!---->
<!-- But even for experienced speakers, most of their conversations about toki pona are studies, analyses, or explorations- all in English. These almost never make their way to toki pona, whether as conversations or usage. Put another way, English conversation about the use of toki pona rivals how much toki pona is actually used, _and_ doesn't influence toki pona very much. -->
<!---->
<!-- This isn't to say these conversations have _no_ influence. If nothing else, these conversations are an important part of how people explore and enjoy toki pona, and have been for as long as I've been around- I've been a part of that too! But that isn't the full story, because there are many more ways to engage with toki pona that _do_ influence it and lead to both greater and _new_ understanding. -->

<!-- ## Realizations -->

<!-- ### Studying toki pona in English limits toki pona and you -->
<!---->
<!-- If you're a learner, this section doesn't apply to you so much, although I recommend -->
<!-- learning from [o pilin e toki pona](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwYL9_SRAk8EXSZPSTm9lm2kD_Z1RzUgm) if you'd like to take my advice as hard as you can! -->
<!---->
<!-- If you're an experienced speaker, I strongly believe that using English to study toki pona is a -->
<!-- limit for you, for your skill in the language, and maybe even your long term interest in the language. Studying toki pona via English means removing a -->
<!-- topic of conversation from toki pona, and thus removing an opportunity to challenge -->
<!-- yourself and learn more about toki pona. -->
<!---->
<!-- If you're interested in toki pona as an object of research, -->
<!-- having those discussions or displaying your results in -->
<!-- English means the exact same thing for you, but from a different angle: Your object of -->
<!-- study will ultimately be less interesting than it could be. Your studies will draw -->
<!-- interest from active speakers, but they'll have those discussions with you in English- -->
<!-- you didn't create an opportunity for them to speak toki pona, so toki pona did not grow. -->

<!-- ### Summary -->
<!---->
<!-- - Most conversations about toki pona are to study it. -->
<!-- - Most conversations studying toki pona are in English. -->
<!-- - If you're studying toki pona in English, you probably aren't influencing the language -->
<!--   much. -->
<!-- - -->
<!-- - But despite all of the above points, it's -->
<!---->
<!-- ## My Advice -->
<!---->
<!-- Use English as a tool. If you're making a cool project, a new study, more lesson -->
<!-- material- you should get people excited about your work by initially sharing it in -->
<!-- English! But once that's done, you should -->

## Other notes

### "toki pona taso is a dead-end ideology"

This is a quote from jan Olipija, who happen to discuss this topic with jan Lakuse and
jan Tepo a few days before I had a very similar conversation with kala Asi. It was
pretty funny to find!

In reading, we're on a similar page about the challenges toki pona has faced in being
its own language and having its own identity, but I don't fully agree with her
diagnosis.

If I understood her correctly, her
imagining of a future toki pona community is primarily bi-lingual

### Aren't you using English right now?

Yep! This article is for those who primarily use English to discuss toki pona.
