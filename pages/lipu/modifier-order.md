for my part, i think the left-to-right analysis faded into the any-order
analysis as toki pona became more established in terms of its number of speakers
by the time i was speaking toki pona comfortably, the any-order analysis was
more popular for pedagogical and pragmatic reasons.

pedagogically, any-order is easier to explain and understand. then, if it's
wrong or at least inaccurate compared to reality, it's still accurate _enough_
that a learner can catch up on the differences later.

pragmatically, modifier order doesn't matter because even if it does matter to a
given speaker, the listener doesn't have enough time at the speed of language to
reliably evaluate the nuances of one order versus another and then respond.
language itself is already very resilient against error- i can most often still
understand you through typoes, bad enunciations, grammatical errors, entirely
substituted words, and tons more errors- not to mention issues with signal
quality e.g. over a call.

to that end, i would find it sincerely surprising if modifier order mattered in
a way that people reliably noticed. frankly, sometimes there are phrases which
you'd struggle to tell the difference in meaning even with _pi_ missing from
them. and the conversation keeps going without issue!

summarizing that- any-order modifiers are easier. even if modifier order matters
to somebody, if that order were messed up, you'd probably still understand what
that person meant.
