the reason i don't use newer words is bc i find more enjoyment out of exploring
and extending the capability of the palette that exists, rather than adding more
things to the palette

it has the same effect but feels more capable and dynamic, since the listener
has a basis of understanding for the words I use, where they wouldn't for newer
words
