things i like about the textbook:

- thorough and guides you through exercises
- multiple choice instead of totally open ended for many exercises
- stories!
- excellent guiding advice that is common throughout the teaching community, like the recommendations to break up ideas/avoid repetitive grammatical structures, understanding words as
- examples given as part or all of conversations
- memorization tests for the words

things i don't like much:

- no sitelen pona :despair~1: i wish for more sitelen pona learning resources. if sp is in it at all i don't even know where to look bc it's not in the TOC
- the words are introduced alongside a glyph that relates to the idea of the word, but only sometimes. obv it's harder for some words but it's an odd choice
- the shorter stories are given on the same page as their english equivalent
- "nimi pona (Correct Answers)" is used a few times as a heading for the answers to the exercises- and, both are correct, but it's weird to show them together consistently
- some examples given are intentionally partial sentences; this isn't a problem most of the time, but it is with la where a common mistake is to end a sentence on la
- **kepeken transitive verb meaning "to use" is in here :guns: **

things i'm on the fence about:

- the definitions at the back are broken into part of speech.

factual errors:

- page 63 errantly states that modifier order matters, "words are grouped left to right"

quality/accessibility issues:

- this problem is only on the back of the textbook, but there's Bad kerning in my printing
- some of the images are visibly blown up to fit the textbook and are really blurry to read; this isn't frequent, but it happens a lot during the body part chapters

notes about all of this

- i like it more than not, but it's Hella dense, and makes me think my own lessons should be pruned down some
- the things i don't like are either common to most lessons (no sp) or pretty minor (the rest)
