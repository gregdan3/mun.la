% A door is not a hole!

Not long ago, I spotted an inconsistency in how [toki pona]{.tp} is used: A fair
number of people use [lupa]{.tp} to refer to a door... in its entirety. Not just
the gap made by opening the door- that is, the doorway- but the entire door: front-facing
surface, gap, and concept, all in the word [lupa]{.tp}. It's like [lupa]{.tp} is
a one-word lexicalization for "door".

The issue is, **a door is not a hole!** Or rather, it isn't _always_ a hole.
When a door is shut, it's a front-facing surface- a [sinpin]{.tp}. When you're
talking about the door as a means to get to or from the inside of a building,
that's a [nasin]{.tp}. But it is only when the door is open that it has a hole,
and so it can only be described as a [lupa]{.tp} then.

But when I've pointed this out to some people, I've gotten some surprising
pushback. Why isn't a door a [lupa]{.tp}? It has a hole sometimes, right? And we
mainly use it for that reason- the hole lets us pass through it, which we do
many times a day. What do you think of when you think of a door? Going through
it. That's a [lupa]{.tp}, right?

It's more complicated than that. Let's think about it in terms of another common
object: Ice! Ice is a solid, which is perfectly described with [kiwen]{.tp}. If
you wanted to be specific about the type of [kiwen]{.tp}, you can add on
[telo]{.tp} as a modifier, creating [kiwen telo]{.tp}. But you wouldn't put [telo]{.tp}
first when describing ice. Ice is not a liquid, so [telo]{.tp} doesn't describe it
correctly!

And I'd argue that calling a closed door a [lupa]{.tp} is a lot like referring
to ice as [telo kiwen]{.tp}- Ice is only a liquid at other times, just like how a
door is only a hole at other times. Put another way, you have the right idea with
the concepts that you want to express, but they aren't correct _right now_.

Still, a lot of people use [lupa]{.tp} to refer to a door in _all_ contexts. I
suspect the disconnect comes from how we most often interact with doors, which
is to open and shut them. The thing is, using [lupa]{.tp} to refer to a door in
this context is **actually fine**! If you say "[mi open e lupa]{.tp}", that would
mean "I open the hole." There's nothing wrong with that, because to open a door,
you must turn it into a hole. The same goes for "[mi pini e lupa]{.tp}," which
means "I close the hole." Again, there is no problem.

But what if you wanted to **look at a door?** Suddenly, the word you choose
matters, because the door can be open or closed- so it could be [lupa]{.tp} or
[sinpin]{.tp}. It could even be [nasin]{.tp}. Let's try it out:

![](./soweli-sinpin.jpg)

What is this cat doing? If we say "[soweli li lukin e lupa]{.tp}", "the cat is
looking at a hole", we're being misleading- there is no hole there. There is a
door, and the place where it stands is a hole at other times, but there is not
_currently_ a hole.

Because of that, it would be more apt to say "[soweli li lukin e sinpin]{.tp},"
"the cat is looking at a front-facing surface." When the door is shut, it is a
front-facing surface and not a hole- so the way we describe the door changes to
match. Unlike when we open or shut the door, it matters _how_ we refer to the
door. The door is either open or shut in this moment, and that determines how
you would describe it- just like the ice example from before.

That said, you _could_ still refer to the door as a [lupa]{.tp} _if_ it is in
the context of it being a hole in those other times, such as talking about the
past or future, a hypothetical, or a want for something to change. In doing
this, we could instead describe the cat like so: "[soweli li wile tawa lupa.
taso lupa li pini]{.tp}", "The cat wants to go through the doorway. But the
doorway is closed." In this context, [nasin]{.tp} can fit just as well as
[lupa]{.tp}.

All of this is to say, a door is not _always_ a [lupa]{.tp}. But sometimes, it
is! And now, you're equipped to recognize when you're using [lupa]{.tp}
incorrectly, and find better ways to describe doors in [toki pona]{.tp}. Sometimes,
you'll realize that [lupa]{.tp} is still the best way to refer to a door. But sometimes,
you'll help someone realize they're making this same mistake, and it can be a great
learning moment!
