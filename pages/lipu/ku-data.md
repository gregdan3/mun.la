It's worth keeping in mind that the ku data lacks almost 4 years of development
in the understanding of words' semantic spaces

Most words haven't moved too much, which is a discussion that could go on for a
_while_, but esun is one that has changed to have much more utility in the form
of non-transactional exchanges, breathing and swapping being common examples.

In general, words can and do change meaning over time- or more aptly, they
usually grow to mean more things. The "more" things are of course related to
what people already understood the word to mean.

If somebody you're speaking to uses a word in an unfamiliar way, but it makes
sense without explanation? Boom, the semantic space of the word has grown _for
you_. And you can, of course, be on either side of this exchange. You don't even
necessarily need to go on and use this particular meaning yourself- you
understand it, and that's enough.

The meaning of words is known by repetition and exposure- you can do this with
examples given in another language, but the most exciting parts of it are done
_in toki pona_.

To make this point clear, [mi kama sona e ni tan jan Tepo: sina jo e lipu mute
mute luka luka tu li wile musi kepeken ona. ni la sina **nasa** e lipu. ni
li weka e nasin tan kulupu lipu la sina kama jo e lipu sin la sina ken ala
sona e lipu kama]{lang=tok}. (bolded the word that surprised me its usage, and
still made sense, when i originally heard it)
