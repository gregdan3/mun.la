a friend of mine asked me why there is no word for three in Toki Pona and this
is how I chose to explain it, i hope you enjoy:

> The word for one can also be used to refer to uniting things, or to unions
> themselves
>
> The word for two can be used to refer to dividing things, or to portions of
> those things
>
> The word for three does jack fuck all besides mean three
