This is a script for an upcoming video, which I'll be adapting into a script for you to learn yourself!

<!-- cut -->

toki a- mi jan Kekan San! I wanna tell you about the easiest language, Toki Pona.

<!-- anim: tokipona logo appears to right, fades out before next line -->

Toki Pona is a constructed language, like Klingon in Star Trek, or Valyrian in Game of Thrones.

<!-- anim: klingon logo slides in from above -->
<!-- anim: star trek logo slides in from above, right of klingon logo -->
<!-- anim: Valyrian logo slides in from below -->
<!-- anim: game of thrones logo? slides in from below, right of Valyrian logo -->

But Toki Pona isn't for fiction- it's for fun! And it's so simple, you could teach it to a rock.

<!-- anim: rock falls into ?hand? ?right of frame? -->
<!-- sfx: on rock landing, minecraft stone place -->

---

But how does it work?

<!-- sfx: rock ?fades out? with minecraft stone breaking -->

Toki Pona has very few words- 120 to 130, depending on who you ask.

And that works because all the words are broad like "bird" or "tool", rather than specific like "sparrow" or "jackhammer."

<!-- anim: waso sitelen pona fades in -->
<!-- sfx: pencil drawing sound -->

<!-- anim: ilo sitelen pona fades in -->
<!-- sfx: pencil drawing sound -->

<!-- anim: sparrow flies in from right -->
<!-- sfx: sparrow chirps once -->

<!-- anim: jackhammer falls in -->
<!-- sfx: dull jackhammer sound for a quarter second or less -->

<!-- idea: jackhammer falls onto stone, breaking it? -->

You might think that makes it hard to talk- but you already do this in English!

If somebody asked you, "Want some fruit?", then offers a bowl of fruits you've never seen before, you might look at everything in the bowl and say, "Sure, I'll have this red one."

<!-- anim: "want some fruit?" bowl, giving hands fade forward with bowl -->

They didn't need to name each fruit, and you didn't either.

The word "fruit" is broad, covering all kinds of fruit.

<!-- anim: many random fruits appear -->
<!-- sfx: pop sound with each -->

And all you needed to do was describe the fruit you wanted!

In Toki Pona, every word is like this: broad and descriptive!

---

This is true for the name of the language too:

"toki" describes talking, conversation, language, thinking, and many similar things.

<!-- anim: talking emoji, two people talking, "language stock photo", thinking emoji -->
<!-- anim: "many similar things" prayer, dial-up internet, instant messaging, more? -->

"Pona" describes good things like being friendly, positive, trustworthy, and more.

<!-- anim: TODO: no idea -->

Together, "Toki Pona" can refer to friendly conversation, positive thought, or "good language".

<!-- idea: show each sitelen pona "toki" and "pona" near each word? combine them into 
logo on the last line? -->

---

You can always use more words to be more specific, but a ton of fun comes from asking, "Can I say this more simply?"

Because of that, Toki Pona feels a bit like a puzzle or a game.

<!-- anim: puzzle or game -->
<!-- sfx: board game pieces sloshing in a box -->

But Toki Pona isn't _just_ for fun. It's a real language, and it's the easiest to start in.

You can learn all the words and have your first conversation in less than a week.

---

It still takes time to be skilled, like any language, but there's other good news:

If you've ever struggled to learn a language on Duolingo, you probably need more conversations!

<!-- anim: "on duolingo" bird shows up right of screen -->
<!-- anim: after "more conversations" bird slides off quickly -->
<!-- sfx: bird squawk on slide off -->
<!-- sfx: metallic crash sound shortly after squawk -->

But it's hard to have conversations in a language you're new to- you need people who are interested in talking to you, but also patient and willing to correct you.

With Toki Pona, _everyone_ will be patient, helpful, and excited to talk, no matter your skill level.

<!-- sfx: mario maker applause, cheering?  -->

And there are lots of other reasons to try Toki Pona.

I feel that Toki Pona made me a better teacher, and more thoughtful about how I use all language.

You can use it to grow as an artist, writer, or software developer-

<!-- anim: paint swatch -->
<!-- anim: pencil and paper -->
<!-- anim: entire computer -->

Or to make new friends by sharing the language.

Many in the community are queer, neurodivergent, or both- and you'll find a home if that's you too.

If nothing else, Toki Pona is perfect as a secret language for you and twenty-nine of your closest friends.

If you wanna learn Toki Pona, check the description for lessons and communities, and ask questions in the comments!

<!-- anim: link communities? lessons? -->

If you already speak Toki Pona, show this video to the next person who asks, "What's that language?"

<!-- anim: thinking person? -->

And thank you so much for watching! o toki pona!
