Hey everyone, I'm gregdan3, and today I wanna tell you about Toki Pona.

Toki Pona is a constructed language, like Klingon in Star Trek, or Valyrian in Game of Thrones.

But Toki Pona isn't for fiction- it's for fun!

---

Toki Pona has about a hundred-twenty or a hundred-thirty words, depending on who you ask.

This works because its words are broad, like "bird" or "tool", rather than specific like "sparrow" or "jackhammer"

You might think that makes it hard to talk- but you already do this in English!

---

Think of the word "fruit."

If somebody asked you, "Want some fruit?", then offers a bowl of fruits you've never seen before, you might look at everything in the bowl and say, "Sure, I'll have this red one."

They didn't need to name each fruit, and you didn't either.

The word "fruit" is broad, covering everything in the bowl.

And describing the fruit you wanted was enough!

In Toki Pona, every word is like this: broad and descriptive!

---

Because of that, Toki Pona often feels like a puzzle. Let's try it on the name of the language:

"Toki" means talk, conversation, language, think, and many similar things.

"Pona" means good, positive, pleasant, friendly, and more.

But together, "Toki Pona" can mean friendly conversation, positive thought, or "good language".

---

You can always use more words to be more specific, but a ton of fun comes from asking, "how can I say this, simply?"

But Toki Pona isn't just a game. It's a real language, and it's the easiest to start in.

You can learn all the words and have your first conversation in less than a week.

---

Like any language, it still takes time to get good, but there's other good news:

<!-- TODO: better way to explain that duolingo sucks? -->

If you've ever struggled to learn a language on Duolingo, you probably need more conversations!

But it's hard to have conversations in a language you're new to- you have to find people willing to be patient and correct you, but still interested in talking to you.

With Toki Pona, the whole community will be patient, helpful, and speak with you, no matter your skill level.

---

<!-- TODO: better wording? stronger claim? -->

And there are lots of other reasons to try Toki Pona.

I feel that Toki Pona made me a better teacher, and more thoughtful about how I use all language.

You can use it to grow as an artist, writer, or software developer.

You can use it to make new friends online and in person, whether speaking Toki Pona or sharing it as a weird, cool hobby.

And if nothing else, Toki Pona is perfect as a secret language for you and twenty-nine of your closest friends.
