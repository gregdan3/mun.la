Yesterday, I published a video titled "What is the Easiest Language." For
obvious reasons, I pitch Toki Pona as the "Easiest Language" in that video.

Why did I do that?

There are a huge number of barriers to becoming skilled in any natural language.

Natural languages have enormous numbers of words. You may need to know dozens or
hundreds of words to begin practicing your target language.

Natural languages frequently have complex grammar, making it daunting to either
interpret or construct a sentence in the first place.

Natural languages are loaded with cultural marks and idioms that add an extra
layer of difficulty onto interpreting a sentence, because the literal reading

Natural languages have sounds that may be unfamiliar to you, and learning to
distinguish a brand new sound is a barrier unto itself

And on top of all of this, it is often difficult to find somebody to practice
with unless you have the confidence to push through

Simply put, almost all of these barriers disappear with Toki Pona.

Toki Pona only _has_ around 130 words, and you can read or make a surprising
number of sentences with just a dozen of them.

And the Toki Pona community is incredibly patient and kind.

There's an argument to be made that Toki Pona is still as hard to learn as a
natural language, and I think it does have merit- but Toki Pona and its
minimalism win here, because Toki Pona _looking_ easy is half the reason it _is_
easy.

But all of this is posturing. Unfortunately, I'm talking around an important
issue:

What does somebody mean when they ask, "What is the Easiest Language?"
