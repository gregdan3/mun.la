Hey everyone, I'm gregdan3, and I want to tell you something important.

But Toki Pona isn't _from_ anything- it's not for fiction, it's for fun!

Toki Pona is also a language with very few words.
You've heard that English has tens of thousands of words, and so do most other languages.
Toki Pona has about 130 words- Fewer words than bones in your body!
And it gets away with this because all the words have a broad meaning.
'toki' means 'language', but it also means talk, conversation, and think.
'pona means 'good', but it also means positive, pleasant, and help,

But you might be wondering, Why is Toki Pona? Why should you learn it?

In most languages, you'll hear somebody say one thing but mean something else.
They may be speaking figuratively, using metaphor, or using a common word in an uncommon or unexpected way.
But when you ask them what they mean, the question isn't always welcome.
Even the most patient people will get frustrated when you don't understand them, and worse, some people may not bother speaking to you after just one misunderstanding.
This doesn't happen in Toki Pona.
Toki Pona relies on context, on common experiences, on mutual understandings- and every speaker understands this.
Sometimes, you have to ask, "ni li seme?" What is this? and the question isn't just welcome- it's expected, and wanted!
