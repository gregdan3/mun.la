Hey everyone, I'm gregdan3, and I want to tell you something important.

This starts with a question: What is Toki Pona?

Toki Pona is a constructed language. As in, somebody sat down and made it.
You might know Valyrian from Game of Thrones, or Klingon from Star Trek- these are constructed languages from famous fiction.
But Toki Pona isn't _from_ anything- it's not for fiction, it's for fun!

Toki Pona was made by Sonja Lang in 2001- she's told us why before, saying, "It was my attempt to understand the meaning of life in 120 words" and <!-- "TODO: depression quote" -->.
Today, there are many people in many groups learning and speaking her language.
Toki Pona grows and changes all on its own today.

But wait- you heard me say Toki Pona has 120 words, right?
English has tens of thousands of words, and so do most languages.
Toki Pona has about 130 words today- Fewer words than bones in your body!
And it gets away with this because all the words have a broad meaning.
'toki' means 'language', but it also means talk, conversation, think, and to speak about.
'pona means 'good', but it also means positive, pleasant, to help, and to repair.
With all this, the words "toki pona" could mean "good language", "positive thought", "helpful conversation," and tons more!
There's no word for "chair" like the English word "chair", but there are plenty of words you can use to describe a chair- and Toki Pona is all about description.

When you explain something in Toki Pona, you break that something down into small pieces, explain those pieces, and help your listener rebuild the original idea.
It's a lot like teaching- instead of using jargon, you explain an idea with comparisons, common experiences, or related ideas.
You go back and forth, checking for understanding, until you're both on the same page.
Toki Pona is great at this- it doesn't even have jargon to use!

On that note: Often, when somebody discovers Toki Pona, they might assume its small vocabulary is a limit.
You can't talk about complicated things- how could you?
That seems reasonable on the surface- There aren't any complicated ideas in the language!
But in reality, that couldn't be further from the truth.

On the note of creativity, and most important of all, Toki Pona is art. Toki Pona is art made by working together with others who speak Toki Pona.

Two quick things I need to address before we go on: What Toki Pona is _not_.

---

First: Many people, when they hear about Toki Pona's small number of words, compare it to Newspeak in George Orwell's dystopian novel 1984.

The purpose of Newspeak is to prevent using language to organize rebellion or even think freely. It does so by being very simple- few words, few distinct concepts. Just like Toki Pona, right?

But Toki Pona doesn't do what Newspeak does in the story. In fact, the opposite is true- Toki Pona encourages, enables, even _grows_ your creativity and expression.

I've spoken Toki Pona for over two years now, and in that time, I've seen incredible art, music, poetry, deep discussions, presentations, and more.

Given this, I don't believe anything like Newspeak _could_ hurt your creativity or expression- these would just take new forms in the new language.

But either way, the only connection between Toki Pona and Newspeak is "simplicity." And each use their simplicity in different ways.

Toki Pona is not Newspeak. It's a simple language, with simple rules, and is still endlessly creative and expressive

Second: Many people, when they hear about Toki Pona's small number of words, assume it can only than talk about the weather and what you ate today.

Simply said, this is not true. You can communicate complex concepts in Toki Pona, and further, you can do so in few words even in English.

But you might be wondering, Why is Toki Pona? Why should you learn it?

In most languages, you'll hear somebody say one thing but mean something else.
They may be speaking figuratively, using metaphor, or using a common word in an uncommon or unexpected way.
But when you ask them what they mean, the question isn't always welcome.
Even the most patient people will get frustrated when you don't understand them, and worse, some people may not bother speaking to you after just one misunderstanding.
This doesn't happen in Toki Pona.
Toki Pona relies on context, on common experiences, on mutual understandings- and every speaker understands this.
Sometimes, you have to ask, "ni li seme?" What is this? and the question isn't just welcome- it's expected, and wanted!
