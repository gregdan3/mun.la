### You're in a computer

### I'm in a computer

### Or are we?

---

<!-- there are so many things -->

![bg left](./nanpa/many_things.png)

### There are so many things

### Is a computer good enough for them all?

---

<!-- but the things can hide -->

![bg left cover](./nanpa/things_missing.png)

### Big things can go away when you aren't looking

### Little things do this too

<!-- computers like the small work -->

## So, the computer has an easy job!

## This is great for the computer.

## You can't see what's different either!

## What makes everything numbers?

---

<!-- reason 1 -->

![bg left:60%](./nanpa/brain.jpg)

#### Can people be in computers?

#### The brain has to be in a computer for this. The brain must be real.

#### If the brain is real and you, you can be in a computer.

---

![bg left:60%](./nanpa/powerful.jpg)

<!-- reason 2 -->

#### Will computers get better?

#### Now, computers aren't good enough for brains.

#### Computers get two times as good every two years. It will happen!

---

![bg left:60%](./nanpa/future.jpg)

<!-- reason 3 -->

#### Do people want to put people in computers?

#### People want to know about people from a long time ago

#### People will probably want to do this a long time from now!

---

<!-- review reasoning -->

![bg left 120%](./nanpa/review.jpg)

### Can computers understand the brain? Yes!

### Will computers be good enough? Yes!

### Will people want to put people inside computers? Yes!

## How many people are in computers? How many are not?

---

<!-- argument in favor of ^ -->

![bg left:60% 100%](./nanpa/calculator.jpg)

### One person with a computer can put many people in it

### This means there are _way_ more people in computers than not

---

<!-- fight -->

![bg left:66%](./nanpa/boxing.jpg)

### But maybe you don't agree!

### What could make this wrong?

---

<!-- counterarguments -->

![bg left:66%](./nanpa/weak.jpg)

#### You may not be from your brain

#### The brain may not be all real

#### Computers may not get good enough

---

<!-- still -->

![bg left:66% 100%](./nanpa/street.jpg)

#### People may not be around a long time from now

#### Or they might not want people inside computers

---

![bg left:60%](./nanpa/what.webp)

### How important is all of this?

### To me, not at all!

---

<!-- but fuck all the counterarguments -->

![bg left:60% 100%](./nanpa/great.jpg)

### The brain is real, and you

### Computers are becoming great

### People will still be around

### Maybe you're in a computer

### Maybe you're not

### You don't know

### But this doesn't matter

### You're here

### Your friends are here

### Love is here
