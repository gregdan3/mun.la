The goal of this lesson is to teach you just enough parts of toki pona to try
having a conversation! We'll very quickly cover every important topic by working
through a series of examples that work together. We'll also learn words along
the way!

It may seem hard to learn a new language, its writing system together, and its
grammar all together, but don't worry: The symbols represents something about
the word, so learning the word, symbol, and meaning all at once is much easier!
And for the grammar, it's all about practice!

### Saying Hello!

We'll start with saying hello!

Toki Pona doesn't have a specific word for "hello". That's how the entire
language works, actually: none of Toki Pona's words are specific!

Instead, "hello" is part of the word [toki]{.tp}. And it covers every kind of
greeting!

|                   Word                    | Definition                                 | Writing                                                     |
| :---------------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| [toki]{.glyph}<br/>[toki]{.glyphsubtitle} | talk, conversation, think, language, hello | Circle with 3 lines coming from it, like sound from a mouth |

<details> <summary> [toki]{.tp} </summary>

- Hello!
- Hi!
- Hey!
- 'sup!
- Howdy!
- G'day!
- Good morning!
- Good afternoon!
- Good evening!

</details>

That's it! If you're starting a conversation with somebody, hit 'em with a
[toki]{.tp}!

### Subject-verb Sentences

But now that you've started a conversation, you need to say something- a whole
sentence!

The most basic Toki Pona sentence has two parts: a [subject]{.h1} and a
[predicate]{.h2}. The subject does something, and the predicate is what they do!

|                   Word                    | Definition                                 | Writing                                                     |
| :---------------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
|   [mi]{.glyph}<br/>[mi]{.glyphsubtitle}   | I, me, myself, we, mine, ours              | Pointing at yourself with your left hand's thumb            |
| [toki]{.glyph}<br/>[toki]{.glyphsubtitle} | talk, conversation, think, language, hello | Circle with 3 lines coming from it, like sound from a mouth |

<details> <summary> [mi toki]{.tp} </summary>

- I am speaking!
- I speak.
- I talk.
- I converse.

</details>

This is where that no-specific-words thing really matters.

[mi]{.tp} refers to yourself, the same way "I" does in English, but it could
also be "we" or just "both of us"- it's not singular, it's any number!

Then, [toki]{.tp} refers to talking, conversation, thinking, and language- but
it could be talking right now, a conversation from last week, or a speech I'm
giving in a few months.

The important thing to know, is that the specific thing a word _does_ mean
depends on where it is in the sentence, and what's going on when the sentence is
said.

Right now, I am speaking to you, and talking about myself- so "[mi toki]{.tp}" would
translate as "I am speaking"

But if the two of us were talking back and forth, it could also be "We are
having a conversation."

Let's continue!

> [sina kute.]{.tp}

|                   Word                    | Definition                           | Writing                                                     |
| :---------------------------------------: | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| [sina]{.glyph}<br/>[sina]{.glyphsubtitle} | you, yourself, yours, y'all, y'all's | Pointing at someone with your right hand's index finger     |
| [kute]{.glyph}<br/>[kute]{.glyphsubtitle} | ear, hear, listen, pay attention to  | Ear shape curving out to the right, tiny line in the middle |

[sina]{.tp} refers to who you're speaking to, the same as "you" or "y'all" in
English.

[kute]{.tp} refers to hearing and listening, and ears too.

But you'll notice that [kute]{.tp} is in the predicate, and that I'm speaking to
you- so you're listening to me.

In other words, the meaning of this sentence is "You are listening" or "you
hear."

### Objects

Next, we'll clarify that sentence by adding to it- because, what _are_ you
listening to?

|                Word                 | Definition                               | Writing                 |
| :---------------------------------: | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| [e]{.glyph}<br/>[e]{.glyphsubtitle} | (mark an object; begin an object phrase) | Two right-facing arrows |

> [sina kute e mi]{.tp}

This is nearly the same as the previous sentence- but now, it has an object.

You can think of the object as something to act on, change, or interact with.

Otherwise, we already know all the words here- sina is you or y'all, kute is
hear or listen, and mi is I or we.

The object marker "e" shows that the subject, sina, does something to the
object- here, the something is "kute!"

So, this sentence means "You are listening to me" or "you hear me."

### Yes/no Questions

But now, what if you have a question? No language is complete without questions,
and Toki Pona is no different.

There are actually three ways to ask questions in Toki Pona, but we'll focus on
the easiest: yes or no questions!

To ask a yes or no question, you double the first word of the [predicate]{.h2},
then put [**ala**]{.tp} (ala) in between.

|                   Word                    | Definition                        | Writing                                  |
| :---------------------------------------: | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| [sona]{.glyph}<br/>[sona]{.glyphsubtitle} | knowledge, understanding, to know | Piece of paper with three lines overhead |
|  [ala]{.glyph}<br/>[ala]{.glyphsubtitle}  | no, not, none, nothing            | An "X" shape                             |

> [sina sona ala sona?]{.tp}

[sona]{.tp} refers to knowledge, understanding, and information, and [ala]{.tp}
is making this sentence into a question. Keeping in mind that this conversation
is me speaking to you, I'm asking you "do you understand?"

Then, you need to be able to answer the question! To answer "yes", you say the
doubled word- so for this question, "sona" means "yes."

> [sona!]{.tp}

To answer "no", you say "ala". You can also say "sona ala." Either way, it means
"no" or more literally, "don't understand."

> [ala!]{.tp}

---

But either way you answer, I want you to understand!

And we'll need two sentences to express that idea.

> [mi wile e ni: sina sona]{.tp}

|                   Word                    | Definition          | Writing                    |
| :---------------------------------------: | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| [wile]{.glyph}<br/>[wile]{.glyphsubtitle} | want, need, to want | Curvy letter "w"           |
|   [ni]{.glyph}<br/>[ni]{.glyphsubtitle}   | this, that          | An arrow pointing downward |

In English, we can easily put together multiple related ideas in a single
sentence. You can do that in Toki Pona, but not as easily- and the more you do,
often the harder you are to understand!

Instead, we often use the word "ni" to refer to previous or following sentences,
to the same effect: ni means "this" or "that."

In this first sentence, [wile]{.tp} means to want or need, and ni refers to the
next sentence.

In the second sentence, I'm stating a literal fact: "sina sona", "you
understand."

But it changes meaning thanks to the first sentence: It's not that you do
understand and I'm telling you that. It's that I want you to understand! And
that's the appropriate translation.

This is critical: Two or more sentences can work together to express more
complex things than individual sentences! And that makes sense on the surface,
but now we've seen it in action.

<!--This new sentence is capable of changing things in the world. The subject can-->
<!--now act on other things, applying the predicate to something else, with the use-->
<!--of [e]{.tokipona}!-->

### Other Subjects with li

Two more topics! First, what if we wanted to talk about something other than
you, or me?

> [sona li pona e sina]{.tp}

|                   Word                    | Definition                                   | Writing                |
| :---------------------------------------: | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
|   [li]{.glyph}<br/>[li]{.glyphsubtitle}   | (mark a predicate; begin a predicate phrase) | One right-facing arrow |
| [pona]{.glyph}<br/>[pona]{.glyphsubtitle} | good, simple, easy, fix, repair, help        | Friendly smile         |

### Saying Goodbye

We'll finish this lesson by saying goodbye.

Once again, there is no specific word for goodbye! But there are common ways to
tell somebody goodbye- for the person leaving, they'd state that literal fact:
"mi tawa."

But for every other goodbye, you generally wish someone well as they leave, or
continue what they were doing.

> [mi tawa!]{.tp}

> [tawa pona!]{.tp}

> [awen pona!]{.tp}

|                   Word                    | Definition                            | Writing                                      |
| :---------------------------------------: | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| [tawa]{.glyph}<br/>[tawa]{.glyphsubtitle} | move, go, travel                      | Legs walking to the right                    |
| [awen]{.glyph}<br/>[awen]{.glyphsubtitle} | remain, stay, continue, stop, protect | Pair of legs standing still, feet facing out |
