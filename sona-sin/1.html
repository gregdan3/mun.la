We'll very quickly cover every important topic by working through a series of examples that work together. We'll also learn words along the way!</p><p>It may seem hard to learn a new language, its writing system together, and its grammar all together, but don't worry: The symbols represents something about the word, so learning the word, symbol, and meaning all at once is much easier! And for the grammar, it's all about practice!</p><h3 id=saying-hello>Saying Hello!</h3><p>We'll start with saying hello!</p><p>Toki Pona doesn't have a specific word for "hello". That's how the entire language works, actually: none of Toki Pona's words are specific!</p><p>Instead, "hello" is part of the word <span class=tp lang=tok>toki</span>. And it covers every kind of greeting!</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center>Word</th><th>Definition</th><th>Writing</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><span class=glyph>toki</span><br><span class=glyphsubtitle>toki</span></td><td>talk, conversation, think, language, hello</td><td>Circle with 3 lines coming from it, like sound from a mouth</td></tr></tbody></table><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tp lang=tok>toki</span></summary><ul><li>Hello!</li><li>Hi!</li><li>Hey!</li><li>'sup!</li><li>Howdy!</li><li>G'day!</li><li>Good morning!</li><li>Good afternoon!</li><li>Good evening!</li></ul></details><p>That's it! If you're starting a conversation with somebody, hit 'em with a <span class=tp lang=tok>toki</span>!</p><h3 id=subject-verb-sentences>Subject-verb Sentences</h3><p>But now that you've started a conversation, you need to say something- a whole sentence!</p><p>The most basic Toki Pona sentence has two parts: a <span class=h1>subject</span> and a <span class=h2>predicate</span>. The subject does something, and the predicate is what they do!</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center>Word</th><th>Definition</th><th>Writing</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><span class=glyph>mi</span><br><span class=glyphsubtitle>mi</span></td><td>I, me, myself, we, mine, ours</td><td>Pointing at yourself with your left hand's thumb</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center><span class=glyph>toki</span><br><span class=glyphsubtitle>toki</span></td><td>talk, conversation, think, language, hello</td><td>Circle with 3 lines coming from it, like sound from a mouth</td></tr></tbody></table><details class=details><summary class=summary><span class=tp lang=tok>mi toki</span></summary><ul><li>I am speaking!</li><li>I speak.</li><li>I talk.</li><li>I converse.</li></ul></details><p>This is where that no-specific-words thing really matters.</p><p><span class=tp lang=tok>mi</span> refers to yourself, the same way "I" does in English, but it could also be "we" or just "both of us"- it's not singular, it's any number!</p><p>Then, <span class=tp lang=tok>toki</span> refers to talking, conversation, thinking, and language- but it could be talking right now, a conversation from last week, or a speech I'm giving in a few months.</p><p>The important thing to know, is that the specific thing a word <em>does</em> mean depends on where it is in the sentence, and what's going on when the sentence is said.</p><p>Right now, I am speaking to you, and talking about myself- so "<span class=tp lang=tok>mi toki</span>" would translate as "I am speaking"</p><p>But if the two of us were talking back and forth, it could also be "We are having a conversation."</p><p>Let's continue!</p><blockquote><p><span class=tp lang=tok>sina kute.</span></p></blockquote><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center>Word</th><th>Definition</th><th>Writing</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><span class=glyph>sina</span><br><span class=glyphsubtitle>sina</span></td><td>you, yourself, yours, y'all, y'all's</td><td>Pointing at someone with your right hand's index finger</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center><span class=glyph>kute</span><br><span class=glyphsubtitle>kute</span></td><td>ear, hear, listen, pay attention to</td><td>Ear shape curving out to the right, tiny line in the middle</td></tr></tbody></table><p><span class=tp lang=tok>sina</span> refers to who you're speaking to, the same as "you" or "y'all" in English.</p><p><span class=tp lang=tok>kute</span> refers to hearing and listening, and ears too.</p><p>But you'll notice that <span class=tp lang=tok>kute</span> is in the predicate, and that I'm speaking to you- so you're listening to me.</p><p>In other words, the meaning of this sentence is "You are listening" or "you hear."</p><h3 id=objects>Objects</h3><p>Next, we'll clarify that sentence by adding to it- because, what <em>are</em> you listening to?</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center>Word</th><th>Definition</th><th>Writing</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><span class=glyph>e</span><br><span class=glyphsubtitle>e</span></td><td>(mark an object; begin an object phrase)</td><td>Two right-facing arrows</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote><p><span class=tp lang=tok>sina kute e mi</span></p></blockquote><p>This is nearly the same as the previous sentence- but now, it has an object.</p><p>You can think of the object as something to act on, change, or interact with.</p><p>Otherwise, we already know all the words here- sina is you or y'all, kute is hear or listen, and mi is I or we.</p><p>The object marker "e" shows that the subject, sina, does something to the object- here, the something is "kute!"</p><p>So, this sentence means "You are listening to me" or "you hear me."</p><h3 id=yesno-questions>Yes/no Questions</h3><p>But now, what if you have a question? No language is complete without questions, and Toki Pona is no different.</p><p>There are actually three ways to ask questions in Toki Pona, but we'll focus on the easiest: yes or no questions!</p><p>To ask a yes or no question, you double the first word of the <span class=h2>predicate</span>, then put <span class=tp lang=tok><strong>ala</strong></span> (ala) in between.</p><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center>Word</th><th>Definition</th><th>Writing</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><span class=glyph>sona</span><br><span class=glyphsubtitle>sona</span></td><td>knowledge, understanding, to know</td><td>Piece of paper with three lines overhead</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center><span class=glyph>ala</span><br><span class=glyphsubtitle>ala</span></td><td>no, not, none, nothing</td><td>An "X" shape</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote><p><span class=tp lang=tok>sina sona ala sona?</span></p></blockquote><p><span class=tp lang=tok>sona</span> refers to knowledge, understanding, and information, and <span class=tp lang=tok>ala</span> is making this sentence into a question. Keeping in mind that this conversation is me speaking to you, I'm asking you "do you understand?"</p><p>Then, you need to be able to answer the question! To answer "yes", you say the doubled word- so for this question, "sona" means "yes."</p><blockquote><p><span class=tp lang=tok>sona!</span></p></blockquote><p>To answer "no", you say "ala". You can also say "sona ala." Either way, it means "no" or more literally, "don't understand."</p><blockquote><p><span class=tp lang=tok>ala!</span></p></blockquote><hr><p>But either way you answer, I want you to understand!</p><p>And we'll need two sentences to express that idea.</p><blockquote><p><span class=tp lang=tok>mi wile e ni: sina sona</span></p></blockquote><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center>Word</th><th>Definition</th><th>Writing</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><span class=glyph>wile</span><br><span class=glyphsubtitle>wile</span></td><td>want, need, to want</td><td>Curvy letter "w"</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center><span class=glyph>ni</span><br><span class=glyphsubtitle>ni</span></td><td>this, that</td><td>An arrow pointing downward</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In English, we can easily put together multiple related ideas in a single sentence. You can do that in Toki Pona, but not as easily- and the more you do, often the harder you are to understand!</p><p>Instead, we often use the word "ni" to refer to previous or following sentences, to the same effect: ni means "this" or "that."</p><p>In this first sentence, <span class=tp lang=tok>wile</span> means to want or need, and ni refers to the next sentence.</p><p>In the second sentence, I'm stating a literal fact: "sina sona", "you understand."</p><p>But it changes meaning thanks to the first sentence: It's not that you do understand and I'm telling you that. It's that I want you to understand! And that's the appropriate translation.</p><p>This is critical: Two or more sentences can work together to express more complex things than individual sentences! And that makes sense on the surface, but now we've seen it in action.</p><h3 id=other-subjects-with-li>Other Subjects with li</h3><p>Two more topics! First, what if we wanted to talk about something other than you, or me?</p><blockquote><p><span class=tp lang=tok>sona li pona e sina</span></p></blockquote><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center>Word</th><th>Definition</th><th>Writing</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><span class=glyph>li</span><br><span class=glyphsubtitle>li</span></td><td>(mark a predicate; begin a predicate phrase)</td><td>One right-facing arrow</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center><span class=glyph>pona</span><br><span class=glyphsubtitle>pona</span></td><td>good, simple, easy, fix, repair, help</td><td>Friendly smile</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id=saying-goodbye>Saying Goodbye</h3><p>We'll finish this lesson by saying goodbye.</p><p>Once again, there is no specific word for goodbye! But there are common ways to tell somebody goodbye- for the person leaving, they'd state that literal fact: "mi tawa."</p><p>But for every other goodbye, you generally wish someone well as they leave, or continue what they were doing.</p><blockquote><p><span class=tp lang=tok>mi tawa!</span></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span class=tp lang=tok>tawa pona!</span></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span class=tp lang=tok>awen pona!</span></p></blockquote><table><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center>Word</th><th>Definition</th><th>Writing</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center><span class=glyph>tawa</span><br><span class=glyphsubtitle>tawa</span></td><td>move, go, travel</td><td>Legs walking to the right</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center><span class=glyph>awen</span><br><span class=glyphsubtitle>awen</span></td><td>remain, stay, continue, stop, protect</td><td>Pair of legs standing still, feet facing out</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=exercises>Exercises</h2><h2 id=summary>Summary</h2><h3 id=what-did-you-learn>What did you learn?</h3><ul><li>With <span class=tp lang=tok>toki</span>, you can say hello!</li><li>With mi, you can talk about yourself and what you're doing!</li><li>Using sina, you can talk about whoever you're speaking to!</li></ul><h3 id=test-yourself>Test yourself!</h3><p>Here's a hint: All of these</p><blockquote><p><span class=tp lang=tok>toki!</span></p><p><span class=tp lang=tok>mi toki pona!</span></p><p><span class=tp lang=tok>sina sona ala sona?</span></p><p><span class=tp lang=tok>mi wile e ni: sina sona</span></p><p><span class=tp lang=tok>tawa pona!</span></p></blockquote></div><div class=footer><h1 class=tp>o toki tawa mi</h1><p><a href=https://youtube.com/@gregdan3d><img src=/buttons/youtube_s.gif alt="@gregdan3d on YouTube"class=button> </a><a href=https://github.com/gregdan3><img src=/buttons/github_s.gif alt="@gregdan3 on GitHub"class=button> </a><a href=https://discord.com/users/497549183847497739><img src=/buttons/discord_s.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Discord"class=button> </a><a href=https://gregdan3.t.me/ ><img src=/buttons/telegram_s.gif alt="@gregdan3 on Telegram"class=button></a></p></div><script src=/sptoggle.js></script><script src=https://livejs.com/live.js></script><script data-goatcounter=https://jankekansan.goatcounter.com/count async src=//gc.zgo.at/count.js></script></div></html>
